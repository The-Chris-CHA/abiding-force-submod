TEXT_PLANET_INFO_HUK_HISTORY,Huk, located in Wild Space, is the forest homeworld of the sentient insectoid Yam'rii. Once sufficiently technologically advanced the Yam'rii became avaricious and expansionist, pushing outwards to colonise other planets in the vicinity of their homeworld. The Yam'rii had no respect for the indigenous sentient species they encountered on their new colonies and were known to enslave, trade and sometimes even eat members of species such as the Quor'sav and Kaleesh. Eventually the Kaleesh rose up against their oppressors and the Yam'rii were almost wiped out by their former livestock in what came to be known as the Huk Wars - until they managed to twist the facts and persuade the Republic to intervene on their behalf as the victims of Kaleesh aggression.

While the initial attacks by these forces in 10 ABY were successful, they soon began infighting, a process which Palpatine believed would weed out the weak. Among the casualties from what would be called the Imperial Mutiny were multiple of the Super Star Destroyers which had disappeared to and set out from the Deep Core- Whelm (Executor-class) and Panthac (Mandator-III-class) which destroyed each other at Alsakan, Javelin (Vengeance-class) which rammed a torpedo sphere defending Chasin, and the Aculeus (Mandator III-class), which was destroyed by TIE Droid squadrons over Drearia.

Believed to be the result of Arkanian experimentation with the Human genome, the Thyrsians and their neighbouring Echani are diametrical opposites in both culture and appearance; the only commonality between the two sub-species being a shared history of strong warrior traditions. The famed Sun Guard mercenaries started out as a Thyrsian special forces unit founded during the Begali Uprising against the Echani-led leadership of the Six Sisters which eventually morphed into the nomadic army centuries later once peace was re-established between Thyrsus and Eshan.

After its rediscovery in the final century of the Old Republic Alaris Prime was the subject of several legal and physical clashes between Wookiees from Kashyyyk and the Trade Federation, both of whom claimed ownership and colonisation rights to the moon. Alaris Prime teems with a multitude of flora and fauna and is abundant in natural resources, including rich seams of valuable nova crystals that made it such a desirable target for the Trade Federation. The forests are thick with wroshyr trees thought to be native to nearby Kashyyyk; no accepted scientific theory has explained how the trees could have migrated across space between the two.

TEXT_PLANET_INFO_GOBINDI_HISTORY,An Outer Rim planet in the Noonian Sector, Gobindi was covered in excessively humid jungles that allowed diseases to thrive. The ancient Gobindi people had constructed massive stone ziggurats all across the planet, with long wooden bridges stretching between them. Though extinct before the time of the Galactic Empire, a metropolis of had grown atop their ancient ziggurats, allowing offworlders to avoid the jungles altogether, much like the Gobindi peoples once had. Unfortunately, the thriving medical facility in the capital city of Mah Dala was secretly co-opted by the Imperial Biological Warfare Department, with Dr. Borborygmus Gog intending to weaponize an ancient plague! Codenamed Project Starscream, he was thwarted by Zak and Tash Arranda with the aid of rebel hero Wedge Antilles. Thankfully, the ancient Gobindi had left behind records of both viruses and their cures for them, and Imperial medical researcher Dr. Kavafi was able to synthesize an antedote to halt the spread of the plague.
TEXT_PLANET_INFO_FWSEN_HISTORY,Though the lingo would be lost on most, for those living in the remote, southwestern reaches of the galaxy, the term "Fw'Sen" was synomous with the stubborn promise of life. The oviparous Fw'Sen was known to mate only once before reaching sexual maturity, and then carried those fertilized eggs within its body until finally gave birth in early adulthood. So it was with the Fw'Sen system. A long time ago, the system featured a gas giant and a flourishing terrestrial planet. But at some point, the gas giant absorbed and fractured its sibling planet, leaving its scattered pieces of it floating around within its gassous mass. But life finds a way, and jungles have flourished on these floating fragments within the gas giant, including the eponymous Fw'Sen itself. Poetic as Fw'Sen's history was, to the Ssi-ruuvi Imperium, it was merely another world to add to their expansion. Thus, the double planet had the dubious honor of being the namesake of the Imperium's disposably slave-run Fw'Sen picket ships.

TEXT_PLANET_INFO_NAR_HEKKA_HISTORY,Nar Hekka sits just beyond the edge of the Y'Toub system. A cold world with minimal indigenous life, Hutt planners circumvented this by laying down large hothouse domes around cities on the surface. These would house artificial wind generators where off-world vegetation was planted. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, Warmaster Nas Choka conquered the planet during the subjugation of Hutt Space, and Nar Hekka was vongformed after.
