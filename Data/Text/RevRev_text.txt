This alliance of hatred would eventually break down, as Nihilus and his fellow apprentice Darth Sion would oust Traya from her position and exile her. The Dark Lords would go their separate ways, with Nihilus traversing the fringes of known space in his flagship Ravager, hunting Jedi and satiating himself on worlds rich with the Force. The growing hunger caused the dark side to macerate his body to the point Nihilus imbued his spirit into his robes and armor; their humanity dissolved to a primitive intent that saw the whole galaxy as food.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_REVAN,Born in the Outer Rim territories, Revan studied under several Jedi Masters as a Padawan and befriended a fellow Padawan by the name of Alek, later known as Malak. When the Mandalorian Wars broke out, Revan was very keen on actively defending the Republic’s territory and people. Revan’s natural charisma convinced many of his fellow Jedi to follow in his footsteps and join the Republic military, against the Jedi Council’s wishes. Revan and his forces pushed the Mandalorians back and defeated them at Malachor V. Revan and his followers were hailed as heroes, but rather than celebrate, Revan took his people and went in search of a mysterious power he had stumbled across during the war. While missing he and Malak stumbled on a hidden Sith Empire. There they fell to the darkside and found the lost homeworld of the ancient Rakatan empire and the Star Forge. Using the Force powered factory, Revan amassed a powerful military and struck against the Republic he had once defended.
