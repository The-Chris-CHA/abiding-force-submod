TEXT_MISSION_FOEROST_FALLEN_SPEECH_10,They've been given their chance. Negotiations aren't my forte anyway. All ships, bring down the shipyards!
TEXT_MISSION_FOEROST_FALLEN_SPEECH_11,Domb Treetor: The situation is untenable; Foreman Tambor must be informed of this treachery. To any engineers still in orbit, retreat to the planet's surface with any material wealth and shipyard equipment you can take with you.
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_01,Headmaster:  I am the king before whom emperors bow. These were the words spoken by the faceless mask.
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_02,               I know him.  I know his kin.  I have heard of the many guises his kind has taken:
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_03,The Chagrians of Champala know him as Aram Acheron; The inhabitants of Iego as Drol Rhamnus; 
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_04,the Rakata call him Nemesis;      And yet most call him the Great Other.
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_05,Barsen'thor:  Enough.  Ever since you've found this holocron in the catacombs, these walls..     These stones have poisoned your mind, old friend.
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_06,               When did Azaël, Keeper of the Flame of Samûnaru, give up reason for madness?
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_07,Headmaster:  Only a fool calls powers beyond their grasp mad!  What I saw is reality!
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_08,               Beings made of light, who could be everywhere and nowhere at once.  Vaster than nebulae and tinier than cells!
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_09,They assembled solar systems like children with toys.
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_10,I saw birth and death of planets through hands yet to be born. Indescribable powers that are yet to be unleashed.
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_11,All of that shrinks to nothing next to .. him.
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_12,The Great Other is the One Who Remains.  The force that disrupts the balance.  Only she can stop him!
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_13,Barsen'thor:  I refused to help out brothers and sisters in their war and defended your decisions.
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_14,               I should have abdicated your ways long ago.  Whatever you plan, this ends now! 
TEXT_MISSION_FRACTURED_FELLOW_SPEECH_15,Grand Master Yoda:  Something terrible has happened.  Go to Bpfassh, I must.
TEXT_MISSION_GUNNING_GUNRAY_OBJECTIVE_CIS_01,The death of Nute Gunray could cause difficulties for the alliance of the Trade Federation and the CIS.
TEXT_MISSION_GUNNING_GUNRAY_OBJECTIVE_CIS_02,A successful rescue of Nute Gunray will strengthen the alliance between the CIS and Trade Federation.

TEXT_MISSION_GUNNING_GUNRAY_SPEECH_02,Asajj Ventress:  Move one of our ships closer to the Jedi cruiser to begin the boarding maneuver.
TEXT_MISSION_GUNNING_GUNRAY_SPEECH_03,Asajj Ventress:  I will have to speak with my master about this, yet I doubt his mourning will be great.

TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_01_ALT_01,Rule Davenbay:  Welcome back to Dateline Coruscant.  Today with me is my coll-- *rrhkzzz*
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_01_ALT_02,Rule Davenbay: And now a scheduled presentation from the Grand Army of the Republic.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_02,Ultana Anya:  Long time no see, Rule.  Glad to finally be back in the Core.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_02_ALT_01,Ryloth Resa:  This broadcast has been liberated by the Shadowfeed, your daily Separatist news update!
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_02_ALT_02,Ahalas Svindren: Greetings citizens, this is Major Svindren. I'm here to talk about the topic that won't let itself go ignored; separatism.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_03,Rule Davenbay:  And we're just as glad.  What's your initial take on the state of the Outer Rim amid the war, Anya?
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_03_ALT_01,The simpering Kath hounds of the HoloNet are refusing to address the facts, dear listeners.  The Separatist Alliance is getting closer to Coruscant by the day.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_03_ALT_02,The worst excesses of rebellion and anarchy tear at our society, but naive minds continue to pay mind to oft debunked arguments.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_04,Ultana Anya:  It's infuriating, Rule.  The Separatists and the treacherous aliens in their ranks are determined to destroy civilisation itself.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_04_ALT_01,Count Dooku won't stop until that lying Chancellor and his Jedi pawns are all held accountable for their crimes against freedom and prosperity.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_04_ALT_02,The words of Dooku, whose title is not worth the oxygen it takes to say it, bewitch the masses when they have proven hollow at every turn.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_05,You have Skakoans running roughshod over every backwater they conquer, to the Gossam developing weapons of mass destruction, potentially against Coruscant!
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_05_ALT_01,Only then, only then I say, will we have true peace in this galaxy again!
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_05_ALT_02,How can one trust a self-proclaimed man of peace, who has schemed to prevent any serious hope of it even among sympathizers in the Senate?
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_06,The meat droids are pushing them back as best as they're programmed too, but the Jedi keep sending them and the Republic into losing battles like Jabiim.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_06_ALT_01,The Republic claims that our heroic freedom fighters are acting akin to HoloNet serial villains, acting without just cause.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_06_ALT_02,Who can trust the nobility of a man who conspires with thugs like Nute Gunray, the worst example of both corporate and Neimoidian culture?
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_07,Our benevolent Chancellor tries to see the best in that archaic order out of tradition, but monks should not be in charge of our military.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_07_ALT_01,Yet it is the Republic's own inefficacy and failure as a governing body, from the Yam'rii Crisis to the Stark Hyperspace War, that is villainous.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_07_ALT_02,Even now when the butcher General Grievous hopes to drown the Core in blood, Dooku's cries of oppression and tyranny do not abate!
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_08,All the while, the Jedi have not even accepted any culpability over their 'former' members who participate in this insurrection. It's deplorable!
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_08_ALT_01,If it weren't for the Confederacy, the decaying conditions of the Rim would only worsen while the Core fattens itself further off our taxes!
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_08_ALT_02,I'd like to take these last moments to address you directly, Dooku. This is not a revolution you have sparked. This is death and finality. 
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_09,Rule Davenbay:  A very passionate report Anya, thank you for your valued contribution.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_09_ALT_01,So I encourage you, don't listen to their propaganda. The truth is out there!  Ryloth Resa out--
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_09_ALT_02,If you truly desire peace, act on it. Surrender yourself and end this senseless war, or else civilisation itself will plunge into freefall.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_10,We will continue our interview later tonight, but now back to Dyslogia Twang with the reports of the GravBall championship!
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_10_ALT_01,Rule Davenbay:  *rrhkzzz* --back to Dyslogia Twang with the reports of the GravBall championship!
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_10_ALT_02,And to you citizens of the Republic, I bid you safe tidings and farewell. This is Major Svindren, signing off.
TEXT_MISSION_HOLO_HUNT_SPEECH_11,General Grievous:  This is the main HoloNet relay centre for the Core.  I want it to be turned into ash.

TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_01,Jayfon Senior:  At 1300 hours a group of terrorists enacted an assault on our freedom.
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_02,On the very principles this Republic is built on!
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_03,These criminals held the Senate and our Chancellor hostage to demand the release of one of their own
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_04,a Hutt Lord named Ziro.
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_05,To reach their target, they not only massacred eighty-six of our comrades, my dear son among them
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_06,they spat on the ideals of order and justice that we are sworn to protect!
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_07,In this very moment, Ziro and his army of bandits and gangsters are trying to smuggle him out of the city.
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_08,We cannot let this happen!  We will repay this stain on our honor!  We will avenge our brothers and sisters!
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_09,We will tear this city apart if we have to.
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_10,---Now, drag that fat slug out of his hole!
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_11,Ziro Desilijic Tiure:  This is the dumbest plan, I've ever heard!
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_12,We should have been off this horrible planet by now... And where is this Bane anyway?
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_13,Bossk:  Ssshut up and leave the detailsss to us.
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_14,Bane is currently ssstealing the clearance codesss and will meet usss at the ssshuttle.
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_15,Dengar:  Lizzy here is right.  Without them, we'd be blown out of the sky in an instant.
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_16,And anyway, we need a proper distraction regardless, which is what we're sitting around for.
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_17,But our boss planned ahead. In a few hours
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_18,the streets will be flooded with enough chaos for us to just sneak away.
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_19,Ziro Desilijic Tiure:  Why is the universe always just so gruesome to me?
TEXT_MISSION_HUTT_HOSTAGE_SPEECH_20,Bossk:  The riotsss are breaking out, time to bail.

TEXT_MISSION_JYVUS_JOYRIDE_SPEECH_07,K2-B4:  Good work.  With the planetary shield deactivated, our forces can begin the assault on the surface.

TEXT_MISSION_JYVUS_JOYRIDE_SPEECH_11,Hoolidan Keggle:  You dare, brute?  Duro will not bear the shame of surrender under my watch.
TEXT_MISSION_JYVUS_JOYRIDE_SPEECH_12,General Grievous:  Would you prefer annihilation?  Duro will fall with your consent or not.
TEXT_MISSION_JYVUS_JOYRIDE_SPEECH_13,With Jyvus City under our control, my droids are deactivating the planetary shields as we speak.

TEXT_MISSION_LAUGHING_LANCE_SPEECH_06,those traitors are just covering for the failures of their tin man general.  HoloNet News told me all about how they lie.

TEXT_SPEECH_VICTORY2_RESEARCH,KDY Representative: The Victor Initiative Project has proven its combat effectiveness and our team at Kuat along with our Rendili counterparts have formulated further ways to improve the existing Victory-I Star Destroyer design. Our proposed Victory-II iteration will include increased speed along with heavy turbolasers and ion cannons, to counter larger Separatist warships. The engineers at Kuat and Rendili are ready if High Command would invest in it, but I assure you it will be well worth it.

TEXT_STORY_FOEROST_CAMPAIGN_REP_CRAWL_BODY_03,One of these targets is the ancient world of Foerost. For a long time, one of the main shipyards of the Galactic Republic, it has been a Techno Union-owned bastion for decades now, strategically located in the Deep Core....
TEXT_STORY_FOEROST_CAMPAIGN_REP_SPEECH_01,Supreme Chancellor Palpatine:  The reports from Foerost are disturbing.  Our citizens are in fear.  Most of our fleets are currently fighting in the Outer Rim.  How can we defeat Dooku's new weapons of terror?
TEXT_STORY_FOEROST_CAMPAIGN_REP_SPEECH_02,Walex Blissex:  If I may, your Excellency?  In the last months, my team has been working on a new project, the Victor Initiative.  It isn't scheduled for actual deployment for at least another six months, but I fear we have no other choice.
TEXT_STORY_FOEROST_CAMPAIGN_REP_SPEECH_03,Supreme Chancellor Palpatine:  I suppose drastic times call for drastic measurements.  You shall receive your funding.  Deploy our new weapons.  The Republic is counting on it.
TEXT_STORY_FOEROST_CAMPAIGN_REP_SPEECH_04,Jan Dodonna:  Our primary target is Ningo himself.  Terrinald and I shall hunt him down personally.  In the meantime protect our holdings up to Coruscant with everything we have!
TEXT_STORY_FOEROST_CAMPAIGN_REP_SPEECH_04_ALT,Jan Dodonna:  Captain Screed and I will lead the hunt for the newest Separatist creation with the Victory-class warship. Our resources are stretched thin trying to repel Grievous' forces from Dantooine to Eriadu. No matter what it takes, we cannot allow Ningo or anyone else to come even 5 parsecs close to Coruscant! Protecting it will be our highest priority.
TEXT_STORY_FOEROST_CAMPAIGN_REP_SPEECH_05,Supreme Chancellor Palpatine:  While Captain Screed and Captain Dodonna pursue the renegade Separatist fleet; we mustn't repeat the error made two years ago.  Rally an armada; Dooku's pawns have been allowed to roost close to home for too long. Burn the Deep Core into cinders if necessary.

TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_BLISSEX_RESEARCH_FUNDING_BLISSEX_SPEECH_01,Lira Blissex:  Hello, Commander. I enjoy seeing how useful the Tector seems to be in your mission. I hope we can work even closer in the future, yet it seems the recent budget planning of the senate wishes otherwise. Your support among the senators is no secret, which is why I'd like to offer you a deal. If you could speak yourself out for an increased funding of the R&D committee, I am sure I can persuade Kuat to send more of these beautiful ships to you.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_CORE_WORLDS_SECURITY_ACT_PALPATINE_SPEECH_01,Supreme Chancellor Palpatine:  It seems our paths cross only when the days darken. Yet, it can't be denied, that you led us successful through it all so I hope, we can work together once more. My staff and I have presented the senate a new act to increase your and my emergency powers to quickly stop the looming threat of separatism here in the Core. Since many senators still trust your judgement, I am sure should you support this act many others will as well.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_ENHANCED_MILITARY_BILL_MOTHMA_SPEECH_01,Senator Mon Mothma:  Hello, Commander.  As you likely have heard already, the Senate is about to pass a bill that would put the Republic at risk of bankruptcy while handing further power to sector militaries. This is why I and like-minded Senators have pushed for counter-legislation to be voted on soon. Your reputation in the Senate has soared through your actions, so I ask you humbly once more to pull the Republic back from the brink of disaster. Your support could be what prevents imminent catastrophe.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_ENHANCED_MILITARY_BILL_MOTHMA_SPEECH_02,Senator Mon Mothma:  My fellow Senators and I are grateful for your support.  Yet this was just a small step until the end of the war.  I will entrust you to defeat the enemy on the outside, while my colleagues and I will work to preserve the rule of law from within.  Only by holding on to what we are can the Republic hope to endure these dark times.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_ENHANCED_MILITARY_BILL_PESTAGE_SPEECH_01,Advisor Sate Pestage:  Pleasant greetings, Commander.  Since we are both busy people, I will get down to business right away.  The recent events in the war have prompted the Senate to consider to linked actions.  A reformation of the banks including a deregulation and an expandion of ourr glorious clone army.  The latter is unfortunatly linked to the former which is why the bill is meant with some resistance of some certain party of senators, but I am convinced especially you, as a man of war and weapon, knows the importance of better troops including technological upgrades.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_ENHANCED_MILITARY_BILL_PESTAGE_SPEECH_02,Advisor Sate Pestage:  Excellent choice, Commander.  We have informed Lama Su about this revelation and his engineers have sent us schematics for an upgraded clone armor design. Similarily, our scientists on Arkania have begun with the cloning of our templates to slowly decentralise our facilities.  [Phase 2 Clone Research is now available on Kamino]
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_ENHANCED_SECURITY_ACT_MOTHMA_SPEECH_01,Senator Mon Mothma:  Hello. The senate is about to make a critical mistake that could cost us more than just the war: Our freedom and democracy. In this moment, the senate plans to pass an act that grants the Chancellor even more control and power... It will legalize house searches, trials without lawyers, imprisonment without evidence. I know some of Palpatine's confidantes approached you already, yet I urge you to take position against this act.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_ENHANCED_SECURITY_ACT_MOTHMA_SPEECH_02,Senator Mon Mothma:  It warms my heart that you chose the right way.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_ENHANCED_SECURITY_ACT_TARKIN_SPEECH_01,Senator Shayla Paige-Tarkin:  Greetings. I hope you enjoy your time here in the galactic south. Eriadu and family are thankful for your help in silencing those crazy Jedi. For far too long were they allowed to roam free without supervision. This is also why I came to you. You have lots of admirers among my colleagues and soon a referendum will be held about an act that grants the Chancellor more powers while also places the Council below his jurisdiction.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_ENHANCED_SECURITY_ACT_TARKIN_SPEECH_02,Senator Shayla Paige-Tarkin:  An excellent choice. You know how to stand on the right side of history... Reminds me of Wilhuff. You both definitely share the ruthlessness and tactical brilliance.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_FUTURE_MOTHMA_SPEECH_01,Senator Mon Mothma:  I don't believe we've had the pleasure of meeting; I represent a group of Senators calling ourselves the Delegation of 2000. We are concerned with the direction the Republic is taking and the accumulation of power around Palpatine. His true goal has always been the subjugation of law to his own power. You seem to have gained some sway in the Senate as well as the military and executive, commander, so I beg of you to join our cause.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_FUTURE_MOTHMA_SPEECH_02,Senator Mon Mothma:  On behalf of the Senate, I thank you.  The Chancellor's excesses must be stopped.  We will contact you with further information.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_FUTURE_MOTHMA_SPEECH_03,Supreme Chancellor Mon Mothma:  Hereby, I accept the election to the new Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. Even if these times are painted by war and darkness, I am hopeful that the sun may rise again. I will also promise to never give up trust in our Jedi friends and respect their wisdom to end this horrible conflict once and for all.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_FUTURE_PALPATINE_SPEECH_01,Supreme Chancellor Palpatine:  Hello. No doubt some disgruntled Senators have approached you about some of their so-called concerns. Possibly even the Jedi Council. It brings me great sadness to see their political manoeuvring takes precedence over unity in these terrible times. No doubt, with your support we would be able to win enough Senators to our cause to enact the legislation needed to give myself and those with the best interests of the Republic at heart and end this brutal conflict.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_FUTURE_PALPATINE_SPEECH_02,Supreme Chancellor Palpatine:  Good, Commander, good. It warms my heart to see you have the best interests of the Republic at heart as well. In due time, there will be more work to be done but for now we must be on our guard.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_FUTURE_PALPATINE_SPEECH_03,Supreme Chancellor Palpatine:  It darkens my heart to be the bearer of such horrible news, yet the urgency is undeniable. I have evidence that this war is a plot by the Jedi Order to take over the Republic.  I request your allegiance in these uncertain times, for I plan to issue the execution of emergency protocol 66. Drastic measures for sure, yet our only hope against the Jedi tyranny.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_IMPERIALIZATION_SPEECH_01,Lira Blissex:  Good day, Commander. Despite the recent shift in authority within our beloved Republic, no one knows better than you that this war is far from won. I represent the interests of several ship designers who are eager to build on our previous successes. My father in particular spearheaded this field, yet I am convinced that we can go so much further than he dared to dream. I know Chancellor Palpatine has trusted you with the future of our military. With the proper financial support, Kuat Drive Yards can furnish you with warships the likes of which you've never imagined.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_IMPERIALIZATION_SPEECH_02,Lira Blissex:  Our newly created sub-division will solely focus on these beautiful new destroyers. I thank for your support and wish you luck in your hunt for the remains of the separatist military.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_KUAT_POWER_STRUGGLE_GIDDEAN_SPEECH_01,Kuat of Kuat:  Hello, commander. I have heard this isn't the first time a Kuati official disturbs you in your mission. I apologize for Onara Kuat and understand that she is scared of what Giddean Danu's investigations and reformations may find. I understand she tried to gain your support for having Danu be removed from office? I'd like to see that not happening. My aunt can be persuasive, yet I am sure I can make a better offer.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_KUAT_POWER_STRUGGLE_GIDDEAN_SPEECH_02,Kuat of Kuat:  I am very interested in finding out what my dear aunt feared so much about Danu. Whatever it may be, I hope it will help me getting her out of her office and into a nice retirement home.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_KUAT_POWER_STRUGGLE_ONARA_SPEECH_01,Onara Kuat:  Greetings, youngling. I didn't rise to my position by spending the day on pleasantries, so expect none. My work and I speak for ourselves, and neither of us would want that to change. The Republic needs our ships. Something the Chancellor knows and respects. Yet some senators like Giddean Danu of my own home planet of Kuat seem to not understand the importance of KDY and Kuat in the galaxy. I have set in motion a referendum to have that annoyance be recalled and your support in the senate and throughout the galaxy in unmatched. If you help me, it might prove useful for you.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_KUAT_POWER_STRUGGLE_ONARA_SPEECH_02,Onara Kuat:  My recent flagship is nearing completion and will likely just gather dust above Kuat. I am sure you will find it a useful extension of your naval forces. [Onara Kuat can be upgraded on Kuat to a Mandator-II-class]
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_LIRA_BLISSEX,Lira Blissex: I represent the interests of several ship designers who are eager to build on the successes of our Venator design. Certain additional designs are being worked on as it is, but I dream of a warship capable of engaging entire fleets on its own. I know Chancellor Palpatine has trusted you with the future of our military. With the proper financial support, Kuat Drive Yards can furnish you with warships the likes of which you've never imagined.

TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_ORDER_66_SPEECH_15,ANAKIN: I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Sith.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_ORDER_66_SPEECH_16,PALPATINE: Good. Good. The Force is strong with you. A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth . . . Vader. Because the Council did not trust you, my young apprentice, I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot. When the Jedi learn what has transpired here, they will kill us, along with all the Senators. Their betrayal will be dealt with. After you have killed all the Jedi in the Temple, go to the Mustafar system. Wipe out Viceroy Gunray and the other Separatist leaders. Once more, the Sith will rule the galaxy, and we shall have peace.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_SECTOR_GOVERNANCE_DECREE_MOTHMA_SPEECH_01,Senator Mon Mothma:  Hello, Commander. As you likely have heard already, the Chancellor is planned to push a decree that redirects authority and control over local and autonomous systems towards Palpatine's personally chosen Sector Commanders. A turn like this is a disgrace for our democracy itself and we need to prevent it at all cost. Your influence in the senate is unquestioned so I urge you to speak up against these plans.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_SECTOR_GOVERNANCE_DECREE_MOTHMA_SPEECH_02,Senator Mon Mothma:  Today democracy and freedom survived. I wish this was the last battle we have to fight to save it yet I fear this might only be the beginning.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_SECTOR_GOVERNANCE_DECREE_PESTAGE_SPEECH_01,Advisor Sate Pestage:  Pleasant greetings, Commander.  Since we are both busy people, I will get down to business right away.  The recent events in the war have prompted the Chancellor to consider a decree extending the tasks of the sector army commanders as well as expanding general funding of all military branches of the Republic.  The support of an officer with your reputation would likely help it pass in an instant, which is why I come on the Chancellor's behalf to seek your support.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_SECTOR_GOVERNANCE_DECREE_PESTAGE_SPEECH_02,Advisor Sate Pestage:  You have as keen an eye for politics as you do the battlefield, Commander.  With this the sector armies can be managed much more efficiently, and the war will end all the faster.  And when it is over, who knows how much farther your star may rise?  The Chancellor does not forget those who do good by him; I can attest from experience.
TEXT_STORY_GOVERNMENT_REPUBLIC_SECTORS_JOINED,Republic Senator: The local sector forces of Republic worlds across the Galaxy have become fully integrated into the war effort, commander. The full resources of the Republic are now in your hands.

The Delta-6 is a fighter designed in the long tradition of lightweight and stripped-down fighters designed for Force users such as the Jedi. Effectively an engine with 2 laser cannons, the Delta relies on the special abilities of force users to excel but due to its cheap nature it is not uncommon for PDF forces to use the fighter with normal pilots. 
TEXT_TOOLTIP_DELTA7,A high performance KSE interceptor designed by Walex Blissex introduced right before the Clone Wars, the Delta-7 Aethersprite is considerably advanced for its time and expensive to match. The Jedi Order took a liking to the craft and it became the standard flight craft of many Jedi Knights for travel and reconnaissance in their duties. Armed with twin-barrelled laser cannons and powerful sub-light engines, its main weakness is a lack of internal hyperdrive due to lack of space, necessitating an external hyperdrive docking ring.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_DENIMOOR,Denimoor served with K'Kruhk in the Siege of Saleucami. He remained in the navy after the New Order was declared, though he did not agree with the excesses of Palpatine's regime and once quietly covered the trail of his old Jedi comrade.

He has risen to prominence as a sound naval commander and quickly given command of a Star Destroyer.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_DOOKU,Count Dooku was a Jedi Master who was one of the best swordsmen in the Order and the former master of Qui-Gon Jinn. When his faith in the Jedi was shaken, Dooku would fall under the sway of Darth Sidious and leave the Order. Claiming his birthright as Count of Serenno, he secretly adopted the title Darth Tyranus. As the Separatist movement gained momentum Dooku became its public leader, publicly denouncing the Republic and conspiring with corporate leaders to support the nascent rebellion. Throughout the Clone Wars Dooku would be a formidable foe on and off the battlefield with his Dark Side and oratory skills.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_PUNDAR,Dool Pundar of the Trade Defense Force saw his chance when he was sent to blockade the quiet world of Naboo: he sent out a distress call, made a course correction into an obscuring nebula, then seized control of his ship and its droids with the help of a few conspirators. By the time the TDF could spare forces to search for him, it was too late. The crafty Neimoidian became a consummate pirate lord, leading an unpredictable set of raids and fighting off numerous bounty hunters and task forces sent to bring him to justice. One of his favorite strategems is to steal ID codes and masquerade as a Trade Federation freighter long enough for his victims to dock.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_RAINA_QUILL,Before the Clone Wars, she had completed her medical training in hopes of becoming a doctor, but her planet soon was part of the Separatist cause. She joined this cause not for the greed and corruption that its leaders stood for but because she felt that Acherin had the right to secede, no matter what the intentions were. Raina was also worried that the Republic's rule was gradually becoming too absolute. Along with Toma, Raina became one of its top commanders and was a skilled pilot in battle.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SCORCH,Scorch, designation RC-1262, was an elite clone commando who was part of Delta Squad during the Clone Wars. Scorch would receive his nickname in training from his love of explosives-and losing his and his trainers eyebrows for a time to them.

TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAA,Built on mass during the dying period of the Clone Wars, the Mankvim was a light and cheap interceptor which made up for its bad armour and weak weaponry with high speed and numbers. Their short range limited them to planetary defence or carrier operations. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAB,Pairing swarm fighters, Vultures, with swarm bombers, Hyenas, was a cheap and efficient way of dominating the battle space. With sheer numbers, even if a few are shot down, the payload was still delivered and the damage was done.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAC,The Confederacy preferred to establish fighter supremacy through the weight of sheer numbers. Vulture droid fighters were proven to be highly effective in this role. While the Vultures tied down and surrounded enemy fighters, Scarab fighters were able to clean up dogfights and clear the battle space.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAD,In order to support their own capital ships and deal with the Republic’s fleets, the CIS grouped long range fire support ships, such as the ion equipped Munifex, or the turbolaser focused Marauder, together to help whittle down shields and hull of enemy vessels.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAE,In order to rapidly deploy fighters and bombers to establish fighter superiority, the Trade Federation’s C-9979 Carrier was extensively used throughout the Clone Wars by the Confederacy. In order to escort the fragile carrier in hostile space, the Techno Union provided Hardcell missile boats to provide some protection.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAF,In order to protect their larger ships and escort bomber squadrons, the Confederacy organised small wolf packs of anti-fighter Diamond corvettes with Gozanti flotillas accompanying the corvettes to herd enemy fighters and bombers into range of the Diamond’s extensive rapid laser batteries.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAG,Mercenary groups often have access to surprisingly powerful equipment and since the CIS corporations can afford the exorbitant prices, the mercenaries were happy to lend their aid in a variety of engagements. These mercenaries were contracted to provide fighter and bomber support where ordered.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAH,A Planet with divided Loyalties in the war, a significant number of Mandalorians would contract themselves to the CIS despite the neutral status of their homeworld. Some would just be single warriors in search of a payday but lots would band together into mercenary groups or join as an entire Clan. These latter groups would also bring with them their own fighters and gunships which could be used to aid CIS fleets against the growing fighter strength of the Republic Navy. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAI,Before the Clone Wars, the Trade Federation commissioned KDY to build them ships they could use to combat pirate threats. When the Clone Wars broke out, the Trade Federation provided their extensive stockpile of Captor class carriers and  Auxilia class frigates to the Confederacy’s war effort.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAJ,Kolivex corvettes, designed by Geonosian PDF engineers, provided effective point defence against enemy ordnance. In order to help defend the corvette and other ships, Nantex fighters could be launched from the Kolivex.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAK,The small Hardcell tenders can provide support for allied fighter swarms and bombers, but they are fragile. In order to protect the Hardcells, CIS high command assigned Lupus Missile Frigates.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAL,All across the galaxy, planets utilised the ubiquitous Dreadnaught Heavy Cruiser by Rendili for defence against any number of threats. Often these ships would be backed up by smaller, more agile corvettes. When the Clone Wars broke out and spread throughout the galaxy, these planetary defence forces got rolled into the Confederacy’s proper naval forces as valuable assets.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAM,In addition to providing loans and funding to the Confederacy, the Intergalactic Banking Clan also contributed significant military force to the Confederacy Navy, primarily in the form of well armed, though fragile, Munificent Communications ships and the Recusant class destroyers.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAN,Mercenary groups often have access to surprisingly powerful equipment and since the CIS corporations can afford the exorbitant prices, the mercenaries were happy to lend their aid in a variety of engagements. This group was contracted to provide heavy firepower support in a variety of engagements.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAP,As the Clone Wars dragged on, the CIS needed to update their fighters to compete with the Republic’s rapid R&D. The Tri-Fighter proved effective as an interceptor when paired with the Vulture swarms that could easily tie down the enemy.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAQ,The Belbullab fighter and bomber loadouts proved to be rather deadly in the right hands, capable of dishing out more damage and soaking more damage than their swarm counterparts, these fighters and bombers would be deployed by the CIS in more dangerous battle spaces.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAR,Mercenary groups often have access to surprisingly powerful equipment and since the CIS corporations can afford the exorbitant prices, the mercenaries were happy to lend their aid in a variety of engagements. The entire mercenary fleet was contracted to provide full support for the forces engaged in this battle.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAS,In order to break down enemy defences, a siege force requires significant supplies. The DH Omni ship can resupply major forces while the surprisingly manoeuvrable Lucrehulk Core Destroyer and Ginivex fighters defend the cumbersome supply vessel.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAT,The Recusant droid ship, and the larger dreadnought variant, were both designed to provide significant fire support from a distance. They can pepper heavy fire into enemy lines from across a battle space and should enemy fighters or bombers attempt to flank them, they have supplemental lasers to defend themselves.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAU,Engagements requiring a smaller, but still powerful force proved to be the perfect place to pair the deadly ship-to-ship firepower of the Bulwark with the heavy carrier/destroy hybrid Providence.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAV,Having significant firepower from the many ordnance launch bays at the prow of the ships, the Providence C/D and the larger Providence Dreadnoughts could fill many fleet roles and were capable of operating independently given their significant hangar capacity.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAW,To compete with larger and deadlier Republic ships of the late Clone Wars, the CIS took the Bulwark design and improved upon it, creating an even larger and deadlier vessel that could stand toe-to-toe against enemy capital ships.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAX,Lucrehulk Battlecarriers proved very effective in deterring enemy assaults due to how much firepower they could soak before getting severely damaged. As such they provided the perfect escort to the more fragile, Munificent. These ships could help protect the Lucrehulk from direct assault while the Lucrehulk soaked enemy firepower.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAY,The Lucrehulk Battleship traded some of its internal hangar capacity for a much stronger direct firepower loadout of turrets and turbolasers. When assigned to accompany Providence Dreadnoughts and Recusant Dreadnoughts, the resulting firepower and still significant fighter and bomber complement proved to be a powerful fleet to be reckoned with.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AAZ,The Subjugator’s heavy ion cannon proved effective in engagements, but the lack of any support fleet showed a major weakness to bomber assaults. In order to rectify this oversight, the CIS assigned smaller vessels to accompany future Subjugator class ships on any missions. Auxilias and Captors provide excellent fire support and some protection against enemy bombers. Recusants could keep enemy ships at bay long enough for the ion cannon to do its work.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_AIR_RAIDER,Both the HMP and MAF are devastating Gunships for the CIS with high mobility and firepower. They are able to pick and choose their fights, able to run from anything they cannot kill easily. BX Commando teams hitching a lift on the MAF gunships are able to quickly land and secure any gains made by the roaming gunships and potentially even securing a forward base for the CIS. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_ANTI_AIR_BATTERY,While many of the CIS ground assets are capable of some levels of anti air fire, the sheer variety and quantity of Republic airspeeders ranging in capability from the LAAT to the Gaba demands the deployment of a dedicated anti air vehicle where Republic air assets are expected. These important vehicles are weak to a ground attack and are frequently assigned a ground escort to ensure their protection from raids or at least fend off the attack long enough for the HAMLs to retreat back to protection. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_ARMOUR_ASSAULT,The Protodeka is one of many examples of CIS super vehicle designs that never went into mass production. A devastating force alone let alone supported by the firepower of Magna Tri droids and Hailfires. This force can easily overwhelm most Republic positions with ease. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_ARTILLERY,The HAG-M is the CIS indirect artillery vehicle capable of providing long range devastating fire from safety. The J-1 conversely is a direct fire artillery piece capable of providing heavy hits against large targets in line of sight. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_B1_DETACHMENT,The B1, the main infantry of the CIS, is a cheap, flimsy, mass produced combat droid that is really only effective when deployed in mass where the sheer weight of fire from massed carbines can compensate for all its flaws. A repair droid squad is attached to make a token attempt to keep the droid numbers up and reduce combat attrition.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_DEBT_COLLECTION_FORCE,The vast majority of the forces of the CIS came from the private pre-war security forces of several corporations. While meant for “protection” from pirates, these forces were often used to intimate others into securing their business interests or collect perceived debts owed to the megacorporations. Persuader tanks were geared especially towards this task and then repurposed towards shock assaults in the Clone wars. They often were accompanied with Hailfires whose fragile frame often needed protection from attack whilst their missiles rained destruction down any resistance. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_DESTROYER_FORMATION,Destroyer Droids were some of the most feared types of the commonly seen CIS droid infantry types due to their high speed, heavy firepower, and shield generators. The Mk2 version is an even more deadly version with even more guns and ion cannons. A strike force of destroyer droids is lethal to any infantry and even small vehicles with the mass of blaster fire. LR-57 droids lumber behind the nimble destroyers to secure the positions devastated in their wake, freeing up the destroyers to move on to a new target.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_HEAVY_INFANTRY,The B2 is a straight upgrade to the standard B1 design but would never fully replace the B1 in service due to the ease of mass production for the b1. This stronger droid can be supported in combat with the cheaper B1s which have been given better weapons than just massed carbine fire. This pairing has much more firepower and durability than the normal B1 formation. Infantry however tend to be slow and thus PACs are often deployed to carry infantry rapidly forward into the battle.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_HUNTER_KILLER,While the vast majority of CIS infantry forces were massed B1 droids, not all CIS droids were low quality and there were lots of higher quality designs. The Crab droid and Destroyer droids are both fast infantry droids with lots of protection and firepower which can react to threats around the battlefield and support the cheap slow B1s.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_INFILTRATION_TEAM,The BX series Commando Droids are highly expensive but mobile infiltration droids used as special forces for the CIS. Attached Mechanised Assault Flyers allow for even more mobility by acting as a gunship transport for the Commando Droids.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_LIGHT_ARMOUR,Both the GAT and OG-9 are glass cannon vehicles which are highly mobile, pack lots of firepower, but cannot take much damage in return. These glass cannon designs can retreat to the slow bulk of an MTT as a shield from heavy return fire thus acting as a secure pivot point for the more mobile vehicles. This highly mobile force can hit any Republic weak point and retreat from overwhelming enemy presence.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_MANDO_MERCENARY,Not all forces that took part in the Clone Wars were associated with either major faction. Such times of strife allowed many groups to sell their services to the highest bidder. While the government of Mandalore may have remained officially neutral in the conflict, not all Mandalorians accepted this pacifism but sought to maintain their old warlike ways even if it meant fighting other’s wars. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_MEDIUM_ARMOUR,AATs and Persuader tanks were the common tanks deployed by the CIS and in a large number they are capable of overwhelming most opposition especially when escorted by decent quality infantry. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_RECON,STAPs are the CIS version of a speeder bike and their job is to scout out the enemy. When the hostiles have been located the STAP will harass to pin down the enemy to pin and delay enemy forces while heavier forces are brought up although weak forces of infantry can be eliminated by a concentrated swarm of STAPs. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_TRADE_FED_ARMOUR_FORCE,Sometimes the deployment of MTTS and their stowed infantry is not enough to overwhelm enemy positions. In those cases the formation can easily be bolstered with the attachment of several AATs to provide additional firepower from behind the safety of the B1 swarm and mass of the MTTs
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_TRADE_FED_INFANTRY_FORCE,The MTT was a large troop transport that could bring masses of folded up B1s into a battle and then support them with their long range lasers. The appearance of MTTs on any battlefield heralded the deployment of swarms of CIS battle droids. On occasion heavier infantry types like destroyers droids would be transported along as well to supplement the power of the infantry. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_CIS_WALKER_ASSAULT,The Magna Tri droid is a large combat walker deployed by the CIS to deal with heavy vehicle threats or crush fortified positions. A swarm of B1 Droids protect it from any close range infantry support while OG-9s pour additional fire on the enemy from the relative safety behind the Magna Tri Droids.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_JEDI_STRIKE_TEAM,The Jedi are the protectors of the Republic and have served the Republic in its times of need for millennia. These elite Force-sensitives often found themselves in the hardest of fights and the most important locations of the war.  
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_LIGHT_WALKER,With their low profile and high speed, AT-PTs were a popular choice to deploy in small packs to hunt for enemy infantry although their lack of heavy firepower left them exposed to any armoured counter attack. The rare but highly effective AT-XT walker can form a small protective core for its smaller walker cushion to retreat behind in the case of the AT-PTs pack finding a target it cannot deal with itself.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_AIR_ASSAULT_BRIGADE, LAATs are the iconic and extremely common Republic gunship/lander and are used for many different mission roles including commando team insertions and close air support for the landed troops. HAETs abandon the massive troop bay of the LAAT for better sensors and a large gun making them perfectly suited for air support and reconnaissance.   
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_ANTI_AIR_BATTERY,Dedicated Anti Air vehicles such as the UT-AA served an important role during battle in protecting ground troops from the numerous gunships of the Confederates like the dreaded HMP. AT-RTs provide a light escort from any infiltrating infantry which seek to destroy the vehicles or provide early warning of a larger attack. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_ARTILLERY,Not all military formations operate on the frontline. The AV7 provides indirect fire support for lots of Republic ground operations with their long range shells able to devastate unprepared formations from relative safety at the rear of Republic battle lines. AT-APs range further forward using their long range mass drivers as direct-fire artillery pieces in support of troops although they are also capable of dealing with attacks on themselves with their other weapons. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_CLONE_AIRLANDING,In many operations during the Clone wars, Republic forces had to make hostile landings to clear out a beachhead for more forces to deploy. To this end the Gunship/transport hybrid LAAT/i is capable of landing small forces of Clones equipped for assault operations and then supporting them in combat as they storm the target and prepare it for follow on formations. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_CLONE_COMPANY,The Clone Army forms the main element of the Grand Army of the Republic with Clone trooper formations being able to be rapidly redeployed to meet the ever changing demands of the war. Often led into battle by a Jedi, Clones serve as the main infantry of the Republic. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_CLONE_P2_COMPANY,The roll out of Phase 2 Clone Armour took a while to complete but the new armour saw a noticeable improvement in the capabilities of the regular clone trooper. It also coincided with an increase of individualism in the clones. More capable than the purely identical clones that started the Clone wars, Clones still were the mainstay infantry of the Republic and were frequently led into battle by a Jedi. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_COMBAT_AIR_PATROL,The fast and light Gaba-18 Airspeeder is frequently used to rapidly scout out the combat theatre. If a threat is too great for the light guns of the Gaba, heavier assets can be called in as needed. The extremely fast and relatively heavily armed Flashblind airspeeder is frequently able to rapidly respond to requests for additional firepower from the forward recon assets as well as protecting them from aerial interception. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_HEAVY_MECHANISED,The A5 juggernaut was a fast and complex heavy assault vehicle that used its high speed and heavy firepower to storm enemy positions before unloading squads of Republic clone troopers to flush out any remaining enemy and then secure the position.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_HEAVY_WALKER,The AT-TE walker was the mainstay assault walker of the Grand Army of the Republic that saw service from the very start of the war and saw service in nearly every major ground battle. It was frequently and best deployed alongside large groups of clones in mutual support of each other. The AT-OT is the inverse of the AT-TE, losing some of the weaponry and armour of the AT-TE but gaining a lot more room for cargo or passengers. When not deployed in a rear line logistical role, the AT-OT can transport a large amount of clones safely to the frontlines where they can dismount into combat.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_LIGHT_MECHANISED,The Juggernaut series of vehicles are intended for assaulting enemy formations and often did this while carrying their own escorting infantry in their large cargo bays. The heavy infantry carried by these large vehicles can either be used to bolster the considerable firepower of this family of assault vehicles or to hold the land taken by its charge from any counter attack.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_MANDO_MERCENARY,Not all forces that took part in the Clone Wars were associated with either major faction. Such times of strife allowed many groups to sell their services to the highest bidder. While the government of Mandalore may have remained officially neutral in the conflict, not all Mandalorians accepted this pacifism but sought to maintain their old warlike ways even if it meant fighting other’s wars. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_PATHFINDERS,The Phase 2 Armour program improved heavily on the original clone trooper armours in many regards. Perhaps most importantly for the ARC troopers was its ease of customizability giving them even more freedom to specialise for their mission. Alongside the effective Biker Advanced Recon Commando Speeder, these Advanced Reconnaissance Commandos are an elite and fast strike force.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_PDF_ASSAULT,Equipped with light weight rapid fire weapons, PDF assault squads are tasked with capturing enemy locations in close quarter battle or finishing off enemy formations pinned by the fire of line formations. The attached medic squad helps to keep the poor quality PDF soldiers alive. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_PDF_LINE,Expected only to protect Republic planets from low level threats or failing that, delaying the enemy until more forces of Grand Army of the Republic can be deployed; These PDF Squads are equipped with heavy weapons intended to provide a solid base of fire to pin enemy threats. Attached SD-6 infantry Hulk Droids provide some extra firepower and protection to the low quality PDF soldiers. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_RECON,Fast 74-Z Speeder bikes scout out the land in preparation for the enemy and to give information allowing following on formations to deploy in best fashion. AT RTs provide a core of firepower to help rescue any scouts that get heavily engaged.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_REPULSOR_ASSAULT,While walkers were a highly popular design choice for the Grand Army of the Republic, it was recognised that walkers could not fill every role and terrain type. Repulsorlift vehicles were often used in terrain not able to take the weight of the walkers. The UT AT provides heavy firepower for the more mobile Saber fighter tanks to operate around while the ISP run escort to protect the tanks from infantry attack. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_SPEARHEAD,The A6 Juggernaut is an even larger and stronger version of the A5 and one of the largest and strongest ground vehicles fielded during the Clone Wars by the Republic. Expensive and prone to breakdowns, it tended to only see service in the most important theatres of the war. An A6 alone is a mighty threat on the battlefield. An A6 flanked with several A5s could easily roll over all but the strongest position. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REP_SPECIAL_FORCES_TEAM,ARC troopers are the best of the best of Clone troopers but are extremely small in numbers. Clone Commandos are a midpoint between the one man army ARCs and the regular Clone troopers but are still formidable in their combat ability. Working together ARCs and Commandos make for an extremely formidable force capable of devastating surgical strikes. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAA,The Delta 6 was a short ranged and stripped down interceptor designed for usage by the Jedi Order whose force powers could make best use of light weight design and negate its weaknesses. This stripped down nature made it extraordinarily cheap which also made it a popular acquisition for several Planetary Defence Forces even if normal pilots struggled to make best use of its design. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAB,The V-19 was a fighter design rushed into service at the start of the Clone Wars to provide a standard fighter for Clone Pilots. Jedi were also pressed into military service during the Clone Wars where they often preferred to lead their force’s fighters from the front while piloting their Delta 7 fighters
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAC,While the clones were the most visible aspect of Republic Military Forces, the vast majority were non clones. Fighter groups formed from the Planetary Defence Forces and then rotated to active duty into the Republic Navy were common. The Z95 Headhunter was a popular choice for PDF groups due to their versatility, low cost for their performance, and high availability. Headhunters converted into bombers provide the Strike Wing with a lot more firepower against larger targets while more standard Headhunters seek out hostile fighters.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAD,One of the few fighters commonly used by the Republic which had an inbuilt hyperdrive, the Aggressive Reconnaissance Starfighter 170 was intended to reach behind enemy lines to rapidly strike and destroy vulnerable facilities. To do this the ARC had strong lasers and proton torpedoes to rapidly deal damage while a manned turret compensated for the slower speed and lower agility of the design. In addition to its intended role the ARC170 was also used by the Republic as a heavy fighter in traditional battle. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAE,Y wings were the primary bomber used by the Starfighter pilots in the Republic Navy. Despite being heavily armoured and possessing a defence turret, they were not trusted to go into combat alone against any target possessing decent fighter coverage unless there were no available fighters to escort them which could often happen due to the Y wing possessing a hyperdrive while most Republic fighters lacked one. As the standard fighter for the early war Republic, the V-19s often were tasked with such escort even when more modern fighters started to appear for the Republic as the war progressed. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAF,The CIS employed massed fighter tactics in nearly all its battles which prompted the Republic to employ lots of its smaller ships in anti fighter roles such to provide a protective picket for the larger vessels. CR90s and LACs were commonly employed in such roles due to their modularity which allowed for easy conversions of weapons loadouts.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAG,Carracks served in many Planetary Defence Forces before the Clone Wars started which meant that when the war started large numbers of them were available to be folded into the Republic Navy. In war time service they were often formed into wolf packs where their concentrated heavy turbolasers fire could be devastating for ships much larger than themselves. While their own lasers provided some defence against the swarms of CIS fighters, some commanders provided fighter cover launched from the old Class-C frigate which can also provide more protection against smaller vessels. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAH,Small groups of fast multipurpose frigates were frequently kept in reserve by commanders to act as small-scale rapid reaction task forces for when patrolling elements encountered hostile enemies, or to quickly reinforce larger ships which were engaged in battle. Both the Victory 1 Frigate and Arquitens possess the speed needed for this role along with the versatile array of weaponry to reasonably engage any enemy forces they are called to face.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAI,As the war progressed the Republic found it necessary to bolster local PDF forces which were under threat from the CIS or the rising pirate threat. T.I.E Starfighters were a relatively cheap but capable fighter that was also easy for pilots to fly. This resulted in the Republic purchasing large quantities of the fighter not old to fill up hangar capacity of older less prioritised warships but also to aid the defences of loyal planets. Despite never being in the limelight like other Clone Wars fighters, the growing numbers of T.I.Es along with their effectiveness would help influence the decisions of the later Empire to base their fighters on the design's successor.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAJ,As the Clone Wars progressed, more and more planets decided to take their local defences more seriously. As a result many of them sought to increase the quantity and quality of their starfighter forces as many of them had relied on cheap, good enough fighters. Unable to simply replace all their fighters in an instant, many used squadrons of better quality fighters to bolster a wing of cheaper fighters where it could act as a centre point of the formation. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAK,The quality of fighters and bombers possessed by a Planetary Defence Force could vary wildly. While some only had token defensive forces which would likely not resist any determined threat, other planets took their own defence more seriously and sought out better quality forces which could actually hurt any attacker. Despite their unpopularity in the Republic Navy, The H60 Tempest would find its way into the service of such planets as a capable bomber was far better than no bomber craft at all. The ever reliable Cloakshape was a popular choice for planets as it was easily available and highly customisable to match their needs such as escorting the bombers to their target. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAL,Large numbers of corvettes would be produced during the Clone Wars as these small but capable vessels were able to be built in vast numbers compared to the larger warships which gave the Republic the ability to disperse them for the regular duties of war such as patrols and escorts. However at times large numbers of corvettes could be concentrated into a single spot which represents a deceptively high amount of firepower. Such wolf packs of corvettes are a lethal threat to any vessel if injured or otherwise deceptive and their speed and small size allows them to rapidly relocate during the battle to take advantage of any such opportunities. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAM,The venerable Dreadnaught Heavy Cruiser was a near ubiquitous warship across the Republic, both in the Republic Navy and Planetary Defence Forces. The ones frequently found in the service of PDFs were often of lower quality and lacking in the weaponry compared to their Naval cousins, although planets did take modernisation programs during the war to rectify this deficit such as by converting the unused spaces in their Dreadnaughts into hangar bays which could then be used to carry fighters and bombers. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAN,Designed as a troop transport for the Republic’s secret Clone Army, the Acclamator was built on mass and was rapidly forced into other roles especially early in the war where other warships were not available to the Republic Navy in any suitable numbers. Thus the Acclamator became a warship with multiple variants where it could serve in roles such as a backline carrier or frontline brawler. Battle groups of Acclamators could be found through the duration of the Clone Wars in reflection of the capability and versatility their design proved to have. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAO,Both designs were often used for long-duration patrol and assault missions, the contradictory weapon loadouts and combat characteristics of the block-1 Imperial and Gladiator series frigates work well together. Each provides different firepower and support while being relatively fast vessels, allowing them to engage near any target type when covering the other’s weakness.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAP,The Dreadnaught Heavy Cruisers which ended up in the service of the Republic Navy during the Clone Wars were often far better armed and of a better quality in general then the ones remaining in the service of the Planetary Defence Forces. The massive amounts of DHCs made in the decades preceding the Clone Wars resulted in them being the backbone warships of the Republic, especially in the early periods of the war where newer designs were only just starting to be designed or enter service. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAQ,The V-wing became the premier fighter in the service of the Republic during the last year of the war where swarms of the highly capable fighter were sent to destroy any and all fighters sent out by the CIS. The Jedi largely maintained their early war habit of leading from the front in their fighters although their Delta 7 was largely replaced by the highly advanced Eta-2 Actis by this period of the war. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAR,The NTB-630 found life as a heavy bomber for the Republic during the Clone Wars where it was extensively used to bring large amounts of ordinance on CIS targets. The Z-95 was also adopted by the Republic and received extensive modifications into a highly deadly fighter that could be used either to escort the heavy bombers to their target or join them in their attack runs with their own proton torpedoes. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAS,As the Clone Wars progressed, the Republic's tactics adapted as the need for anti-fighter protection from corvettes decreased due to the vast increase in the number and capability of Republic fighters. Furthermore the CIS often attempted to hunt down these corvettes with their own small vessels. This reduced the size of the Republic picket groups along with resulting in less specialised corvettes being dedicated to the task force to provide protection against CIS raiders. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAT,As the Class-C frigate fell out of favour and was seen in fewer numbers their role as support for Carrack Wolf Packs had to be replaced with a frigate that existed in greater numbers. The mass produced Pelta Assault variant fell into this role as although it lacked a hangar, it had sufficient lasers and point defence systems which allowed it to provide anti fighter protection for the carracks along with battling smaller corvettes which challenged the task force.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAU,Gunships were a popular choice for Planetary Defence Forces which require a cheap long range defence option. Skiprays were a durable platform which combined a large array of weapons which allowed it to engage any threat found while the Citadel focused mainly on combating the CIS fighters. Together, squadrons of these Gunships were able to go on long range missions from their base and engage any threat encountered or survive long enough to call in reinforcements. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAV,One of the main weaknesses of the standard Dreadnaught Heavy Cruiser Line was their weakness to CIS fighters and bombers due to the lack of their own hangars and laser weaponry. Thus in order to rectify this weakness in the standard formation, carrier conversion of the PDF DHCs were requisitioned to supplement the cruiser line with some fighter cover and some bombers to project power further out from the formation. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAW,Neutron Stars were freighters rapidly converted into warships in order to fulfil the massively increased demand for convoy escorts which resulted from the Clone Wars. When needed they could also transport their own supplies in addition to being the escorts for other logistical vessels such as the Pelta, another wartime design frequently used to transfer people and supplies to the frontline. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAX,The Victory Fleet was the first and main republic Fleet to get the new Victory Class Star Destroyers alongside the Gladiator Star Destroyer which had been specifically designed to escort the Victory. The Fleet was primarily broken up into two main task forces although even smaller sub formations would be detached where needed. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAY,The Venator Star Destroyer was the backbone capital ship of the Republic Navy due to its versatile nature, large capacity for ground units or fighters, and no obvious weaknesses. This versatility also made the Venator an ideal core for task forces as it could cover all possible threats with one design while just adding more ships to increase the fleet strength. Groups of Venators often made the spearhead of Republic invasion fleets to clear local space of enemies while Acclamators followed in their wake to deliver more ground troops. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_AAZ,The Victory Star Destroyer packed an impressive array of weapons and ordnance but did suffer from a lack of speed which could allow for enemy forces to disengage and flee. The Acclamator II transforms the once troop carrier into a rapid and deadly vessel which can saturate ships or planets in turbolaser fire. When paired with the slow Victory the relatively nimble Acclamators could chase down and finish wounded prey. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_ABA,Designed during the Clone wars but suffered from issues during their introduction, The Imperator Star Destroyer and its sister design the Tector Star Destroyer saw limited service in the war. Both were designed to dominate the fleets of the CIS with the Imperator being extremely well rounded while the Tector lost a lot of that versatility in order to be better against the large numbers of cruisers and frigates fielded by the Republic’s Enemies. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_ABB,The Invincible was a relic of a warship by the time of the Clone Wars but still remained in service due to successive waves of modernisations on the design. By the time of the war it was largely dependent on its deep reserves of concussion missiles to deal with enemies alongside a large array of anti fighter weapons. Victory Star Destroyers escorted by Gladiator Star Destroyers could add their own considerable barrage of missiles to further overwhelm any defences of the enemy and thus ensuring enough missiles arrive on target with destructive results.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_ABC,The Republic made heavy use of carrier warships during the Clone Wars as a direct counter to the droid swarm fighters of the CIS. As the war progressed this eventually resulted in the Republic being able to gain local fighter superiority wherever they focused their industrial and military might. Led by the rare Secutor Star Destroyer, large numbers of Venators and Acclamators could deploy an overwhelming swarm of high quality fighters to gain control of any battle space, followed up by waves of bombers and long range turbolaser fire to eradicate any large vessel in the area. 
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_ABD,Republic naval doctrine underwent a shift over the course of The Clone Wars, the navy began to move away from a reliance on carriers in favour of more direct firepower. The Praetor-I was still unmatched in its class, and the improved Victory II Star Destroyer proved valuable in stripping enemy shields. The new Imperator Star Destroyer was grouped with them to bridge the gap and provide some fighter support.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_ABE,The Republic needed significant firepower and significant fight and bomber reserves in order to overcome the most defensible Confederate worlds and their defence forces. The Praetor-I Battlecruiser was an obvious choice, and in order to provide self-sufficient carrier support, the Secutor class was assigned to accompany the Praetor into hostile space.

TEXT_UPGRADE_CIS_SECRET_HYPERSPACE_ROUTE,Secret Hyperspace Route
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_CIS_DESIGN_TRADE_OFFS,A sad reality is that many of our ship designs were meant for private security operations for corporations. Now they are being used for conventional warfare some issues have been found in their designs and we are not able to fix all of them. Given our production capabilities it might be more effective to sacrifice the survivability of our ships to increase their firepower and speed. This allows for better swarming of the Republic forces.
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_CIS_SECRET_HYPERSPACE_ROUTE,Not all who support our cause do so openly but some remain embedded in the society and government systems of the Republic. One of these anonymous benefactors is willing to divulge to us a seemingly forgotten hyperspace route in return for a generous donation. This route would allow us to bring in unexpected reinforcements from an unengaged taskforce. 
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_HUTT_CARTELS_BOOTANA_HUTTA_REINFORCEMENT,In the ancient past the Hutts used to be the overlords of an expansionist Empire but the devastation of many wars such as the Xim Wars and the later Hutt Cataclysm caused the Hutts to change their philosophy away from wars of conquests with slave armies towards soft power and subversion of others. While the contemporary Hutts outwardly seem relatively peaceful and passive, the Hutts still maintain a secret military on the Core Worlds with the Bootana Hutta Fleet being a strong mobile force ready to crush any unwanted attention aimed at their Core Worlds. If the Hutts ever decide to “wake up” and return to the aggression of old, this fleet could also form the core of a revitalised Hutt Navy.
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_HUTT_CARTELS_PROFIT_MOTIVE,The Hutts are always mindful to find ways to defend or even increase their power and the Hutts have developed a preference to leveraging their economic strength instead of more mindless destructive displays of strength. Overseers squeeze out every inch of profit possible from the economic endeavours under their control while Commanders are careful with the deployment of military forces in order to conserve their strength over the long run to avoid the anger of their Hutt lords at any undue losses and the costs thus incurred in their replacement.
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_ACE_CLONING_PROGRAM,While Jango Fett is the best known clone template, the Republic cloned many other skilled people to meet the needs of its army in the hope that the clones would inherit the abilities and talents of their templates. Secure the allocation of elite clone pilot templates to help clear the area of droids.
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_PDF_FLEETS,Before the cowardly and treasonous surprise attack of the CIS, the Republic had no need of its own navy or army. Instead planets were responsible for their own defences. If needed we can draw on these planetary defence fleets of loyal Republic worlds to bolster our forces although it will mean diverting funds temporarily to their local government. 
TEXT_UPGRADE_FLUFF_REPUBLIC_SECRET_FLEETS,During the course of the war, the Supreme Chancellor channelled money into several black projects. One of those projects was the construction of multiple secret fleets to be deployed at the final moments of the war to secure a victory. While it will temporarily hurt our economy, the surprise arrival of a battle fleet would surely help us gain a rapid victory before the enemy can recover.
