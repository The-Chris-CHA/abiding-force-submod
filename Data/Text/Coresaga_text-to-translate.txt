The unique design of the I-Beam gives it high maneuverability on top of decent firepower, along with its large cockpit making it a favorite of larger creatures.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_MANDALORIAN_SOLDIER,Standard-rate Mandalorian warriors, usually organized from mercenary or warring factions from Mandalore or its colonies. These infantry are not equipped with jetpacks the more specialized commandos bring to battle, yet remain fearsome foes against enemy infantry using homegrown or market weapons. Mandalorian soldiers are able to hold the line or advance in combat with a warrior's zeal passed down through generations of their culture.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_MARAUDER_MISSILE,A refit of the Marauder-class corvette made by the Rebel Alliance after purchasing stolen Corporate Sector Marauders from smugglers. The base Marauder's laser cannons were removed and its engines downsized to accomodate concussion missile pods, in hopes to make an equivalent to the Empire's Broadside Cruiser. The result allows this Marauder variant to provide devastating missile barrages to vulnerable ships at the expense of speed and maneuverability.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_BTLS1_Y_WING,The second of the debut Y-wing models from the Clone Wars, more common in defense forces and garrisons than well-equipped fleets. The S1 Bomber is less armored than the -B series but has better flight performance, leading to it being preferred for further development. It is best used to attack larger enemy vessels with its ion cannons and munitions.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_KEEK,Chief of Brigia's despotic Internal Security Police, Keek was a wicked Brigian who lead the swift ambush that attempted to halt the University of Rudrig's delivery of academic technology to his impoverished home planet. His mission would have succeeded, were it not for the intervention of a pair of freelance smugglers in a modified YT-1300. Treacherous by nature, he was nonetheless a poor liar when it came to dealing with off-worlders.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_PIRATE_FIGHTER,The Rihkxyrk assault fighter is a strong, if sluggish fighter. Developed by TransGalMeg, it is commonly seen among pirate groups such as Black Sun, to the point people associate the term 'pirate fighter' with it exclusively. The heavy-duty shielding and dense armor makes the Rihkxyrk able to withstand attacks that leaves most fighters scrap, with accompanying firepower to give back as good as it gets. Most Rihkxyrk pilots develop a high level of confidence in these fighters after wading through heavy fire and coming out undamaged.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_R22_SPEARHEAD,Inspired by the Aurek, the Tammuz-An designed the Spearhead as a hyperspace capable escort fighter. The Spearhead would prove to be a reliable and long serving hyperspace escort fighter for the Galactic Republic and then later widely used by the Rebellion whose pilots liked to heavily tinker with its design. This modability would see the Spearhead serve not only as a fighter craft but also as a Rebellion experimental test bed. The Spearhead would later receive a wide ranging upgrade program under the oversight of Dodonna and Blissex which would develop into the famous A-wing Interceptor.
TEXT_UNIT_PELTAASSAULT,Pelta Frigate
TEXT_TOOLTIP_H_WING,The Long Range Strike Fighter/Bomber was a successor design to the famous Y-wing however the H-wing would never reach the same levels of fame and mass use of its predecessor. Slow speed, a three-man crew need, and a high cost prohibited any widespread adoption but the design’s heavy armour and armament meant it was seen as worthwhile for limited deployments where its flaws could be ignored.
