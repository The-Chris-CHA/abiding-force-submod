TEXT_CUSOM_CAMPAIGN_GAME_TITLE,Scenario Setup
TEXT_CUSTOM_BODY_DESCRIPTION_01,- Use a variety of prompts and dummy placements to decide what factions will be present and how much territory they should have, as well as what heroes to spawn and what units you can build. Once your choices are made, begin by conquering the planet you want to start at with the GC Starter (hero with a play button icon)
TEXT_CUSTOM_BODY_DESCRIPTION_02,- First choose between the methods to pick enemies and their locations, arranged from simplest to most flexible.
TEXT_CUSTOM_BODY_DESCRIPTION_03,   Random Enemy Location lets you pick your planet and will procedurally generate the enemies you leave in the orbit of your starting planet several jumps away.
TEXT_CUSTOM_BODY_DESCRIPTION_04,   Pick Enemy Location will procedurally generate enemies around the planet where you leave their dummy, unless you sell the dummy or leave in above your starting planet. 
TEXT_CUSTOM_BODY_DESCRIPTION_05,   Pick everywhere spawns a large set of dummies for each faction (including your own) with your starter. When you choose your starting planet, each planet with a faction dummy over it will be given to that facton. Planets that also have a capital dummy will spawn the faction capital, have extra starting forces, and add extra starting credits if the faction already has a capital.
TEXT_CUSTOM_BODY_DESCRIPTION_06,- Standard Roster will leave the starting roster for your faction and era unchanged. Roster Additions will spawn additional units from other eras, research, government mechanics, GC specific units, etc. that can be built. If these are positioned over your starting planet, they will be enabled.Custom Roster will also spawn the default roster and disable units if they are not over your starting planet.
TEXT_CUSTOM_BODY_DESCRIPTION_07,- From the Ground Up gives the player a single planet and AI factions either 4 connected planets or a set of 3 and 2 connected planets. Small start will give each faction connected 6 planets and a small set of starting heroes. Full start will divide almost the whole map among the factions (e.g, appromimately one third of the galaxy for each of three factions) and spawn the same heroes as a progressive map at this era.
TEXT_CUSTOM_BODY_DESCRIPTION_08,   Any leftover planets will be given to Independent Forces. The player faction can use a modifier for a smaller or larger territory (e.g. half with one enemy to split the galaxy into one third and two third, single planet on small start to play FTGU with heroes). In pick everywhere, these choices only affect the hero spawns.
TEXT_CUSTOM_BODY_DESCRIPTION_09,- For advanced users, these scripts are not dependent on map layout. Copying the <Locations> and <Trade_Routes> section from another campaign to a Custom GC's campaign XML will function with the exception that starting planets will be randomized if not present.

TEXT_DOCUMENTATION_BODY_INFLUENCE,Each planet has a loyalty level based on various factors. This influence level has several effects; including chance to get unrest stack (3 unrest stacks will cause revolt) and decreased credit output with lower influence, and other planet- or faction-specific bonuses when at certain levels. It also tends to factor into government mechanics, which can be found in the government tab. Influence updates at the end of each cycle, so the impact of events that change influence may not be immediately felt.

TEXT_PLANET_INFO_AARGAU_FAUNA,Unknown
TEXT_PLANET_INFO_AARGAU_HISTORY,Aargau was a member of the Galactic Republic from its discovery until the end of that galactic power. After the fall of the Galactic Empire, it was considered a New Republic stronghold. The region of space occupied by the planet would later fall under the hegemony of first the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, and then subsequently Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire. Despite this, Aargau took a neutral approach to politics, which meant that warring factions were mutually welcome to conduct business on the planet. The planetary government imposed only three laws on citizens and visitors, called the Three Statutes of Aargau. These laws focused on the export of Aargau's natural resources, the absolute ban on weapons for visitors—and, conversely, the requirement to bear arms for Aargauuns—as well as maintaining the integrity of the Bank of Aargau. Breaking any of these rules was punishable by immediate execution.

TEXT_PLANET_INFO_ABELOTH_WORLD_HISTORY,Located within the unstable cluster of black holes known as The Maw is an unnamed planet with powerful connections to the Force. The planet was once home to the Ones, physical manifestations of the Force referred to as the Son, the Daughter and the Father who represented in turn the dark side, light side and balance of the Force. A fourth being, a mortal woman who served the Ones and later became the Mother, kept the peace between Son and Daughter. In an attempt to gain immortality the Mother drank from the Font of Power and bathed in the Pool of Knowledge, but the experiences from those Force Nexuses corrupted her and she became a powerful, twisted entity known as Abeloth, Bringer of Chaos. Seeing this, the Father, Son and Daughter instructed the Killiks to build Centerpoint Station and other facilities to imprison Abeloth on the planet for eternity.

As it lies only a short distance from a dim red dwarf star, it is dark and murky, but has a day period of 60 standard hours when the planet is blasted by a lethal mix of gamma, infrared, and ultraviolet rays, forcing all life underground to survive. Because all the standing water is evaporated under the intense heat of the day, sudden, torrential downpours can occur at night, forcing the inhabitants to hunt quickly, or be washed away. The native Barabel are superb hunters – highly aggressive and very territorial – often finding work as mercenaries and soldiers. The Barabel have a profound respect for the Jedi, as a Jedi mission engaged both sides in an ongoing civil war and ended an armed conflict that had raged for thousands of years.

TEXT_PLANET_INFO_DATHOMIR_HISTORY,100 000 years ago, Dathomir was the capital of an interstellar empire, its native Kwa the dominant form of life in their corner of the galaxy. With the ascendancy of the Rakata, that all changed, and the Kwa were pushed back to their ancestral homeworld. Among the mountains, deserts, purple savannas, and forests, the Kwa proceeded to degenerate into semi-sentience. Only glimpses of former glory – the Star Temples and Infinity Gates – remain in their collective memory. The galaxy largely forgot about Dathomir until recently, when it was used as a dumping ground for prisoners and exiles – mostly Humans. After Allya, the outcast Jedi Knight, was sent here, the planet single-handedly transformed into a Force-using matriarchal society. Numerous distinct clans of witches exist today, each practicing a slightly different shade of light side magic. Those that fall to darkness are sent off into the wild, ultimately to join the Nightsisters.

TEXT_PLANET_INFO_IOKATH_HISTORY,Iokath was a massive artificial sphere constructed around a star located in the Unknown Regions by a technologically advanced species at some point before the Manderon Period. Every orbital body in the system was demolished and salvaged for core elements, from which an impervious habitat for the species was constructed, using all of it star's energy output. The species of weapon designers created many technological wonders such as the Gravestone, the Eternal Fleet, the GEMINI droids, SCORPIO and the Old Gods, using their superweapons on dozens of different worlds for live testing. When a civil war broke on Iokath, both sides began using their superweapons against each other, which led the engineers to drive many of their creations into Wild Space with their memory cores locked. However, that did not save them, as the Six Gods were unleashed on Iokath, eradicating all organic life on it and leaving a single self-aware droid known as ARIES to reshape the world in his image. Few visitors that found Iokath over the centuries were all killed by ARIES in brutal tests, until many new arrivals came to Iokath around 3631 BBY, in the middle of the war against Zakuul.

TEXT_PLANET_INFO_KESH_HISTORY,Kesh was a remote planet located in Wild Space. It was the homeworld of the Near-Human Keshiri species and an offworld immigrant community of Human Sith known as the Lost Tribe of Sith. Kesh was a terrestrial world with a wide range of different climates and environments including mountains, plains, forests, ocean, and tundra. It had at least three continents in its southern hemisphere: Keshtah, the dominion of the Sith Tribe, Alanciar, and Eshkrene, which was at the South Pole. Kesh was isolated from the rest of the galaxy due to a strange magnetic field that limited hyperspace travel and offworld signals communications. In 41 ABY, the Lost Tribe rediscovered interstellar travel when an ancient Sith Meditation Sphere known as Ship landed on the planet and allied itself with the Tribe. The Tribe then assembled a Sith armada and sought to expand into the galaxy. This put them into contact and conflict with both the New Jedi Order and a powerful entity known as Abeloth.

Naga Sadow placed a citadel there, but unbeknownst to the rest of the Sith at large, Sadow's Khar Delba citadel was a mere decoy; his real base was on Khar Shian. In 5000 BBY, with Naga Sadow in the midst of a power struggle with his rival, Ludo Kressh, Khar Delba was attacked from orbit by forces loyal to Kressh. Although the citadel was badly damaged in Kressh's orbital bombardment of the planet, Sadow emerged victorious after calling in his secret fleet from the far side of Khar Shian to counterattack Kressh. In the following months, Khar Delba was rebuilt and was established as the center of Naga Sadow's power as he gathered a force to invade the Galactic Republic, in a conflict that became known as the Great Hyperspace War.

TEXT_PLANET_INFO_LOK_HISTORY,Lok was one of the first planets in the Karthakk system to be colonized. It was originally home to outlaws who saw the world as a potential staging ground for raids into the Mid Rim. It was a harsh and inhospitable world. Jagged mountain ranges, long expanses of baked desert, desolate flats, dangerous sulfur pools and lava pits were commonly found on the planet. The pirate Nym became a powerful warlord during the years leading up to the Invasion of Naboo and founded a pirate group known as the Lok Revenants. They attacked ships coming and leaving the planet until the Trade Federation decided to invade the planet after one such pirate raid in 32 BBY. The occupation of Lok lasted ten years. The Lok Revenants finally reclaimed Lok during the first days of the Clone Wars, in 22 BBY, thanks to the support of Jedi Master Adi Gallia and the Mere Resistance.

Nearly the entire southern hemisphere of the planet had disappeared, ejected into orbit and forming a gravitational belt of planetary debris, leaving the planet's molten core destabilised and exposed. Despite its broken state, Lola Sayu's northern hemisphere retained a precarious ability to sustain terrestrial life. In 522 BBY the Republic worked alongside its allies, the Jedi Order, to establish an isolated, maximum-security prison that would eventually become known as the infamous Citadel. Designed to contain Jedi who had either gone rogue or fallen to the dark side of the Force, the spire-like facility was constructed on the north-western side of the planet, powered by the geothermal energies from the lava lakes that surrounded it.

Forced to improvise mining tools, the settlers began to extract the minerals, and once they re-established communication with the rest of the galaxy, Makeb became immensely profitable for the settlers within fifty years—a large part of which was the result of the influence and wealth of the original settlers.

However the native Mandallian Giants were trained in several forms of combat from infancy, developing powerful martial skills, and when the Mandalorian Crusaders descended upon Mandallia they were soundly repelled by its inhabitants.

During the chaos, Stars' End was launched high into the low gravity atmosphere, eventually crashing to the surface.

Indeed, many Besalisks ended up enslaved to the Hutt Empire as they struggled to pay the terrible price of their planet remaining free of the Empire's control.

Huge walled cities and a dark side theocracy emerged to protect the people from the beasts, but exiled prisoners learned to control the beasts and overthrew the dark side rulers, effectively firing the opening shots of the Great Sith War. Despite eventual victory for the light side, Onderon has always been a focus of dark energy. It was here that Darth Bane established the Rule of Two, setting in motion the forces that would eventually lead to Sidious’ emergence as Dark Lord of the Sith. A single colossal fortification of Iziz survives, and it now covers a good chunk of the continent.

He returned to Mandalore and told his clansmen of it. New Republic historians connected this vision with the subsequent shift in the Mandalorian religion from worshiping the Destroyer God Kad Ha'rangir, to worshiping war itself. Later, Mandalore the Indomitable's successor, Mandalore the Ultimate, also had a vision on Shogun. This led him to decree that non-Taungs would be admitted to Mandalorian clans if they proved themselves worthy in battle and upheld Mandalorian honor.

When it was discovered that the local undersea snails produced liquid cavansite, a critical component in the production of MagSol and necessary for the entechment process, Shree rapidly transformed into a bustling world of mass energy production. By the Battle of Endor Shree was the largest producer of MagSol with the Imperium naming one of its proudest vessels after the planet. But with the shift in industry came ecological negligence and disaster: beautiful blue ocean vistas became rust-colored hellscapes. Alarmed, the Imperium attempted to reverse the damage.

The native Toydarians are winged mammals with an uncommon natural resistance to influence from the Force. The planet has historical close ties to Hutt Space both as a vassal and trading neighbour and in fact Hutt caravels are one of the few classes of vessel permitted to fly in within the planet's atmosphere - due to the high risk of collisions between airspeeders and the many Toydarians flying about. Toydaria remained officially neutral during the Clone Wars however King Katuunko did allow the Republic to use the planet as a base following an impressive display of strength by Jedi Master Yoda and three clones.

Darth Vader would later establish Bast Castle on the planet, which acted as both the Dark Lord's refuge and a space for his trophies. In the post-Endor period, various Imperial Remnant groups would appropriate Bast Castle, attempting to extract power from it.

TEXT_RESOURCES_HEADER,=============         RESOURCES        =============
TEXT_RESOURCES_OVERVIEW,There are multiple resources in EaWX: 
TEXT_RESOURCES_OVERVIEW_1,- CREDITS: Generated by planets and economic buildings and used to purchase units and buildings. Also, many special events, research, etc. cost credits to initiate.
TEXT_RESOURCES_OVERVIEW_2,- SHIP CREWS: Generated at Academies and spent when constructing ships.
TEXT_RESOURCES_OVERVIEW_3,- POPULATION: Global limit on how many ships and units you can have at once. Increase this cap by conquering planets and building Golan Colonies.
TEXT_RESOURCES_OVERVIEW_4,- INFLUENCE: Each planet you control has its own Influence score. It measures how much that planet's population supports your rule. Planets with low influence can revolt and forcibly eject your troops. Planets with high influence sometimes offer unique buildable units.
TEXT_RESOURCES_OVERVIEW_5,- INFRASTRUCTURE SCORE: This score is the difference between the number of buildings you've constructed on the ground and in space across your whole territory and your territory's total capacity for buildings. When your territory has too many empty slots for buildings as compared to constructed buildings, credit prices and build delays for everything will rise!
TEXT_RESOURCES_OVERVIEW_6,- WORLD DEVASTATOR MATERIALS: Gained by fielding World Devastators and destroying enemy units and structures in tactical space battles.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_BUNKER_BATTERY,A fortified position equipped with several anti vehicle blasters along with multiple firing positions for friendly infantry to utilise.

Their skills are less than a dedicated Force combatant, but even their basic training in the Dark Side makes them a dangerous threat to individual combatants.

TEXT_UPGRADE_TOOLTIP_SPACE_ASTEROID_MINE_INCREASED_HEALTH_FLUFF,Given our reliance on local resource extraction to fund our efforts in this theatre alongside the exposed nature of the local resource deposits to any enemy raids; it is highly advised to invest into efforts to increase the durability of our mining outposts. These will still not enable the facilities to withstand any determined assault but should assist them in surviving minor attacks long enough for allied forces to react and crush the raid.

TEXT_UPGRADE_TOOLTIP_SPACE_SECONDARY_INCREASED_HEALTH_FLUFF,Throughout the campaign in the local sector, commanders might find it necessary to construct or restore additional stations or turrets to provide security for key areas of the battlefield. Improving production quality of the shield generators and the armour plates of these structures would improve their ability to lockdown an area.
TEXT_UPGRADE_TOOLTIP_SPACE_SECONDARY_INCREASED_HEALTH_L1,Increase the health and shields of all secondary stations and turrets from 0% to 10%
TEXT_UPGRADE_TOOLTIP_SPACE_SECONDARY_INCREASED_HEALTH_L2,Increase the health and shields of all secondary stations and turrets from 10% to 20%
TEXT_UPGRADE_TOOLTIP_SPACE_STARBASE_INCREASED_DEFENCE_FLUFF,The central space station serves as our command and control centre for this entire theatre of battle in addition to being the main communication facility which enables us to request further reinforcements. Alongside it the Research Station is what allows us to bolster many aspects of our military forces and local economy. The loss of either space station would be catastrophic to our war efforts and thus measures should be taken to increase its resilience to enemy attacks, be it increasing the armour plates of the station or the durability of their protective shields.
TEXT_UPGRADE_TOOLTIP_SPACE_STARBASE_INCREASED_DEFENCES_L1,Increase the defence of the main and research starbases from 0% to 10%
TEXT_UPGRADE_TOOLTIP_SPACE_STARBASE_INCREASED_DEFENCES_L2,Increase the defence of the main and research starbases from 10% to 20%
TEXT_UPGRADE_TOOLTIP_SPACE_STARBASE_INCREASED_SHIELD_FLUFF,Due to the vital importance of the two main space stations under our control, it is advisable to seek out methods to increase the endurance of their shield generators. The longer the station’s shield can withstand the barrage of enemy fire the longer the station’s weapon systems can remain fully operational and the more time allied forces have to react. This gives the stations the best chance to survive hostile actions.
TEXT_UPGRADE_TOOLTIP_SPACE_STARBASE_INCREASED_SHIELD_L1,Increase the shields of the main and research starbases from 0% to 10%
TEXT_UPGRADE_TOOLTIP_SPACE_STARBASE_INCREASED_SHIELD_L2,Increase the shields of the main and research starbases from 10% to 20%
