TEXT_DOCUMENTATION_BODY_INFLUENCE,Each planet has a loyalty level based on various factors. This influence level has several effects; including chance to get unrest stack (3 unrest stacks will cause revolt) and decreased credit output with lower influence, and other planet- or faction-specific bonuses when at certain levels. It also tends to factor into government mechanics, which can be found in the government tab. Influence updates at the end of each cycle, so the impact of events that change influence may not be immediately felt.

TEXT_DOCUMENTATION_BODY_STORYOVERVIEW,Galactic conquests in Empire at War Expanded have several story elements to them. Some are random missions, some are government related plot events, and some are other kinds of events or missions. Instead of tech levels, the game is broken into several eras which have different events within them. Eras progress automatically. These are going to be updated and added with each version. This guide gives a rundown of all events available to each faction. When starting after the default era, earlier events are usually completed or not based on canon timelines.

Each candidate has different benefits. Elections are determined by how many planets you have above 5 influence. All planets above 5 influence vote for your candidate, and all below vote against.
TEXT_DOCUMENTATION_HELPER_REVOLT_OCCURED,A planet has revolted because of unrest caused by low influence. Influence is tracked in the top left of the screen, or in the bar to the left of each planet. A red fist indicates unrest exists on a planet, and if a planet reaches 3 unrest it will leave your faction within one cycle. See the ingame influence guide for ways to increase influence on your planets and prevent or reduce unrest.

In this mode the economy is derived from a steady flow from the command centre and then two bunkers buildable on the landing points. The economic bunker is weaker but gives more income.

TEXT_INTERVENTION_CONSTRUCT_STRUCTURE_PDF_SPEECH_01,Governor:  The citizens are growing restless. I assume increasing local production throughout the sectors might have a positive effect on the economy and the unemployment rate, painting the war efforts in a more favourable light.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_CONSTRUCT_STRUCTURE_PDF_SPEECH_02,Governor:  The success was greater than anticipated. The conscription numbers are at an all time high, and our new production facilities have made large parts of our former defence gear obsolete.

TEXT_INTERVENTION_PLANET_CONQUEST_PDF_SPEECH_02,Governor:  My world and I owe you much, Commander. I thank you for your help in saving my home. As a sign of gratitude, I detached a unit of our local defence forces to help you in your mission to free this galaxy.

TEXT_INTERVENTION_UPGRADE_STRUCTURE_PDF_SPEECH_01,Governor:  The amount of scavenger attacks has increased drastically. Supply lines and medical transports get attacked. Investing in more local structures will send an important signal both to our people and these pirates.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_UPGRADE_STRUCTURE_PDF_SPEECH_02,Governor:  Our new defences have proven themselves a great investment. During the last assault of these scavengers, we captured some of their gear and weaponry.
TEXT_INTERVENTION_UPGRADE_STRUCTURE_PDF_SPEECH_03,Governor:  If we don't keep up with the demands for more military hardware and contruction capabilities, the enemy will outproduce us in weeks. I hope we will be still alive until then.

TEXT_LORE_IMPERIAL_MUTINY,Lore Holocron: Imperial Mutiny
TEXT_LORE_IMPERIAL_MUTINY_DESCRIPTION,In the years leading up to Shadow Hand, Imperial forces from all over the galaxy began to disappear without a trace, having been called to Palpatine's side as he was preparing his assault from the deep core. While the initial attacks by these forces in 10 ABY were successful, they soon began infighting, a process which Palpatine believed would weed out the weak. Among the casualties from what would be called the Imperial Mutiny were multiple of the Super Star Destroyers which had disappeared to and set out from the Deep Core- Whelm (Executor-class) and Panthac (Mandator-III-class) which destroyed each other at Alsakan, Javelin (Vengeance-class) which rammed a torpedo sphere defending Chasin, and the Aculeus (Mandator III-class), which was destroyed by TIE Droid squadrons over Drearia.
TEXT_LORE_LIINADE_CONQUEST,Conquest of Liinade III
TEXT_LORE_LIINADE_CONQUEST_DESCRIPTION,The battle at Liinade III became a focus of propaganda for both sides after plans for a Death Star-like superweapon were found in its aftermath. These plans rapidly replaced the murder of Sate Pestage as the reason to bring Delak Krennel to justice. For his part, the Prince-Admiral claimed that the plans were planted and that he would never develop such a horrible device. Krennel had been talking with the survivors of Alderaan regarding the establishment of a haven for them, and he sorrowfully announced to the galaxy that he had had Liinade III in mind as its location. In reality, the plans were a counterfeit of the real Ysanne Isard, who used the subsequent investigation to her advantage.
TEXT_LORE_REQUIEM_SQUADRON,Requiem Squadron
TEXT_LORE_REQUIEM_SQUADRON_DESCRIPTION,In the ambush at Distna, a moon of Corvis Minor V, Rogue Squadron was nearly destroyed by a wing of TIE fighters. But two squadrons of TIE Defenders intervened and took the surviving Rogues to the base of a secretive Imperial organization. This group sent the Rogues to Ciutric in a TIE Defender squadron, posing as Requiem Squadron led by one of Wedge Antilles' old aliases, Antar Roat. A message dispatched to the New Republic High Command detailed the timetable of their sabotage mission.

TEXT_PLANET_INFO_AARGAU_FAUNA,Unknown
TEXT_PLANET_INFO_AARGAU_HISTORY,Aargau was a member of the Galactic Republic from its discovery until the end of that galactic power. After the fall of the Galactic Empire, it was considered a New Republic stronghold. The region of space occupied by the planet would later fall under the hegemony of first the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances, and then subsequently Darth Krayt's Galactic Empire. Despite this, Aargau took a neutral approach to politics, which meant that warring factions were mutually welcome to conduct business on the planet. The planetary government imposed only three laws on citizens and visitors, called the Three Statutes of Aargau. These laws focused on the export of Aargau's natural resources, the absolute ban on weapons for visitors—and, conversely, the requirement to bear arms for Aargauuns—as well as maintaining the integrity of the Bank of Aargau. Breaking any of these rules was punishable by immediate execution.

The planet was once home to the Ones, physical manifestations of the Force referred to as the Son, the Daughter and the Father who represented in turn the dark side, light side and balance of the Force. A fourth being, a mortal woman who served the Ones and later became the Mother, kept the peace between Son and Daughter. In an attempt to gain immortality the Mother drank from the Font of Power and bathed in the Pool of Knowledge, but the experiences from those Force Nexuses corrupted her and she became a powerful, twisted entity known as Abeloth, Bringer of Chaos. Seeing this, the Father, Son and Daughter instructed the Killiks to build Centerpoint Station and other facilities to imprison Abeloth on the planet for eternity.

Because all the standing water is evaporated under the intense heat of the day, sudden, torrential downpours can occur at night, forcing the inhabitants to hunt quickly, or be washed away. The native Barabel are superb hunters – highly aggressive and very territorial – often finding work as mercenaries and soldiers. The Barabel have a profound respect for the Jedi, as a Jedi mission engaged both sides in an ongoing civil war and ended an armed conflict that had raged for thousands of years.

The oviparous Fw'Sen was known to mate only once before reaching sexual maturity, and then carried those fertilized eggs within its body until finally gave birth in early adulthood. So it was with the Fw'Sen system. A long time ago, the system featured a gas giant and a flourishing terrestrial planet. But at some point, the gas giant absorbed and fractured its sibling planet, leaving its scattered pieces of it floating around within its gassous mass. But life finds a way, and jungles have flourished on these floating fragments within the gas giant, including the eponymous Fw'Sen itself. Poetic as Fw'Sen's history was, to the Ssi-ruuvi Imperium, it was merely another world to add to their expansion. Thus, the double planet had the dubious honor of being the namesake of the Imperium's disposably slave-run Fw'Sen picket ships.

Unfortunately, the thriving medical facility in the capital city of Mah Dala was secretly co-opted by the Imperial Biological Warfare Department, with Dr. Borborygmus Gog intending to weaponize an ancient plague! Codenamed Project Starscream, he was thwarted by Zak and Tash Arranda with the aid of rebel hero Wedge Antilles. Thankfully, the ancient Gobindi had left behind records of both viruses and their cures for them, and Imperial medical researcher Dr. Kavafi was able to synthesize an antedote to halt the spread of the plague.

However, the army met with disaster in 3963 BBY; after the Mandalorian scientist Pulsipher brought a mysterious Sith artifact known as the Muur Talisman back to Jebble, the Talisman's dark influence turned nearly the entire population of Mandalorians into monstrous, mutated rakghoul beasts.

In 522 BBY, the Republic worked alongside its allies of the Jedi Order to establish an isolated, maximum-security prison that would eventually become known as the infamous Citadel.

Huge walled cities and a dark side theocracy emerged to protect the people from the beasts, but exiled prisoners learned to control the beasts and overthrew the dark side rulers, effectively firing the opening shots of the Great Sith War. Despite eventual victory for the light side, Onderon has always been a focus of dark energy.

There were only a few safe routes into The Redoubt, and they were all guarded by Chiss fortifications, which prevented foreign intrusions.

TEXT_RESOURCES_OVERVIEW,There are multiple resources in EaWX: 
TEXT_RESOURCES_OVERVIEW_1,- CREDITS: Generated by planets and economic buildings and used to purchase units and buildings. Also, many special events, research, etc. cost credits to initiate.
TEXT_RESOURCES_OVERVIEW_2,- SHIP CREWS: Generated at Academies and spent when constructing ships.
TEXT_RESOURCES_OVERVIEW_3,- POPULATION: Global limit on how many ships and units you can have at once. Increase this cap by conquering planets and building Golan Colonies.
TEXT_RESOURCES_OVERVIEW_4,- INFLUENCE: Each planet you control has its own Influence score. It measures how much that planet's population supports your rule. Planets with low influence can revolt and forcibly eject your troops. Planets with high influence sometimes offer unique buildable units.
TEXT_RESOURCES_OVERVIEW_5,- INFRASTRUCTURE SCORE: This score is the difference between the number of buildings you've constructed on the ground and in space across your whole territory and your territory's total capacity for buildings. When your territory has too many empty slots for buildings as compared to constructed buildings, credit prices and build delays for everything will rise!
TEXT_RESOURCES_OVERVIEW_6,- WORLD DEVASTATOR MATERIALS: Gained by fielding World Devastators in space battles and destroying enemy units and structures [TACTICAL BATTLES-only].
