TEXT_TOOLTIP_SKIPRAY,A heavy gunboat sometimes counted as a capital ship in small navies, the Imperial GAT-12h and its successors are a more combat-oriented improvement over the Republic GAT-12g model which lacked the concussion missiles and had a tractor beam for utility. It is best used to attack enemy capital ships but can be turned onto fighters in a pinch due to its turreted lasers.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SKIPRAY_ADVANCED,Heavier Skipray model best known for its increased munitions load over earlier designs. Has otherwise equal performance and durability to the 12H model. It is best used to attack enemy capital ships but can be turned onto fighters in a pinch due to its turreted lasers.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VI,An armed version of the obsolete Super Transport VI armed with makeshift concussion missile launchers attached via external modular pods. A light shield was also added to increase durability under fire. This  resulted in a vessel which was better than nothing in battle and could maybe fend off some minor pirate attacks but worse than any dedicated combat ship.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VI_CARGO,Considered severely out of date by the time of the Galactic Civil War, most of these old massive cargo ships had been replaced by newer models of the KDY Super Transport series by the time of the Battle of Endor. A handful persisted in use around the galaxy although mainly in the hands of pirates who used the large vessel as mobile staging grounds for their raids.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VII,A KDY Super Transport VII Bulk Cruiser modified to be better protected against pirate raids. Laser emplacements along the hull were added to allow the transport to defend itself against fighter attacks while the addition of ion cannons allowed it to try to fend off larger attackers. Weak shielding was also added to the vessel to provide it some additional protection over its civilian grade hull.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VII_CARGO,Smaller than their predecessor, the KDY  Super Transport VII could still carry an impressive 2 million metric tons of cargo. To maximise cargo carrying capacity the base design was slow, unshielded, and unarmed making them extremely easy prey for pirates.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VII_HULL,Hull: 650 (Corvette)
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_VII_INTERDICTOR,A version of the KDY Super Transport VII refitted with a single gravity well generator in its cavernous holds to create a makeshift interdictor. Such an expensive investment also warranted the addition of lasers for self defence so it was not entirely helpless.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_XI,Seeing the adhoc armed refits of the older Super Transport models in response to pirate raids, KDY created their own armed variant of the Super Transport XI. Quad laser cannons were dotted around the hull to provide all round protection from fighter attacks that were frequently a key element in pirate attacks. The token shields of the base cargo design were also heavily reinforced to allow the ship to withstand minor attacks. This redesign turned a once helpless ponderous giant into a nasty surprise for attackers.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_XI_CARGO,A giant KDY freighter capable of holding 25 million metric tons of cargo, a single Super Transport XI can take the place the hundreds of freighters. However this cargo capacity was obtained through the sacrifice of shields, weapons, and engine power. Thus this lumbering beast of a transport is suitable only for the safest routes or routes with sizable escorts. Records show that on occasion enterprising individuals have been witnessed refitting the Super Transport in unexpected ways.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_XI_HULL,Hull: 2345 (Frigate)
TEXT_TOOLTIP_SUPER_TRANSPORT_XI_MODIFIED,KDY's Super Transports are unarmed, lightly constructed cargo containers, but have a surprisingly rich history as makeshift combat support units. After all, the cavernous bay can fit an astonishing number of fighters to someone who only lacks a base, even if it can offer them little protection.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_TECTOR,The battle-oriented counterpart of the Imperator-class that shares the same base hull. It was developed alongside the ISD-1 during the Clone Wars but was never as popular among the Imperial Navy. Additional armor plating and structural reinforcement cover up the reactor dome and hangar bay which lends increased durability at the cost of a fighter escort. It is well suited to battling other large vessels but requires protection from bombers.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_BOMBER,A bomber armed with proton torpedoes. It replaces the unpopular TIE/gt model and is a significant improvement over that design. It is best used to attack the larger enemy ships and space stations along with bombing runs against ground targets.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_FIGHTER,A speedy and maneuverable light fighter that became one of the most recognizable Imperial symbol after being chosen to standardize fighter models shortly after the Empire's founding. It is cheap and lacks shielding and adequate armor compared to other designs. It is best used en-masse to engage enemy fighters and bombers.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TIE_STARFIGHTER,An upgrade of the Republic T.I.E Starfighter, the TIE starfighter was the first of the Empire era designs of the TIE family. While individually more capable than the later more famous TIE Fighter it was also significantly more costly which saw a rapid decline in popularity due to the extensive need for sheer numbers of fighters in the Galactic Empire.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_TNT,Originally a mining vehicle designed for the spice mines of Kessel during the era of the Republic, the Treaded Neutron Torch was adapted into military usage during the collapse of the Galactic Empire as makeshift assault tanks. A hull designed to survive perilous mine shafts offers a surprising amount of protection in combat and torches capable of melting easily through rock are also capable of burning their way through lots of other material that might see use on a battlefield.

It is best used to engage enemy fighters or respond to incoming bombers.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_VAAT,The Variable Altitude Assault Transport/Enforcement was a Rothana Heavy Engineering gunship transport design which predates the LAAT. It lacks the firepower of its successor design but provides a lot more protection to its occupants and is more resilient to incoming fire. It was seen in service in a range of local security forces including those based on Coruscant before the Clone Wars and would remain in service with law enforcement agencies even into the Galactic Civil War.

The capable Valor is a central command and logistical hub for many military operations of the Republic. It is no surprise that such a critical station is bristling with weapon emplacements for its own defence from attack if such eventualities arise.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_VENATOR,An iconic carrier-destroyer hybrid. The Republic-designed Star Destroyer was introduced early in the Clone Wars with a large hangar and notable dual-bridge towers. It relies heavily on its fighter complement and is intended to be supported by other vessels such as its counterpart, the Victory-I. It is decently well rounded in spite of its focus on fighter tactics but best not used against larger ships.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_VENATOR_REFIT,Common Venator-class refurbishment employed by a variety of groups, such as criminal organisations and small Hutt clans. Availability spikes as Clone Wars surplus is sold to local forces and groups or picked up at mothballs. Consists mostly of weapon modifications intended to aid in support of other capital ships and for piracy operations. Has a hard time killing other capital-scale vessels on its own.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_VICTORY_I_FRIGATE,A versatile fast frigate with diverse weaponry, it is the first iteration of a line with roots in the Clone Wars. It is well-rounded but lacks fighter support and is best used to assist larger capitals.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_VICTORY1,A venerable heavy cruiser, the Republic-designed Star Destroyer is meant to complement the Venator-class by focusing on ship-to-ship combat and system defense. It has a powerful battery of missiles for firepower but is hindered by an archaic drive system. It is best used to deal damage to enemy ships with its missile payload and large gun array.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_VICTORY2,A supplemental version of the Victory that loses the missile-cruiser role for a more generalist armament. It was developed from the Victory-I late in the Clone Wars and was not as popular as it or the Venator, but became more common under the Galactic Empire. It is significantly faster due to an overhauled engine system and designed more like a mini-ISD in terms of functional role.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_WLO5_TANK,The Ubrikkian WLO-5 Speeder tank was a popular choice for pirates and other factions in the Outer Rim due to their cheap price and high mobility which the driver could utilise to evade some attacks although they lacked in firepower compared to the tanks in service with the major powers. The design was also noted to be extremely easy to modify and repair which further boosted its popularity in the less wealthy areas of the galaxy.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_Y_WING,A medium bomber design with a design history started in the Clone Wars. The current S3 model was developed to improve on the B and S1 models that served in the war and saw service into the New Republic. It is best used to attack larger enemy vessels with ion cannons and munitions.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_Z95_BOMBER,Z-95 Headhunters have many sub-models used for a variety of combat roles throughout the galaxy. Variants tuned for anti-ship and ground support are common in lower-priority task groups and local forces, adding munitions racks and mountings at a cost of flight performance.
TEXT_TOOLTIP_Z95_HEADHUNTER,An extremely common and dated fighter in significant use throughout the galaxy. The current series is based on the Mark 2 which replaced the older Mark 1 atmospheric interceptor as a voidcraft. This model is armed with the standard laser cannons and missiles.
