TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAR,The indomitable AT-AT is the mainstay assault vehicle of the Empire. The slow but steady advance of a platoon of these heavy walkers often spelt doom to any opponent of the Empire. However, infantry getting into close range or forces which managed to outflank the lumbering beasts could pose a serious threat to the AT-ATs. Thus they are nearly always deployed alongside the support of smaller and faster vehicles to shepard the enemy into areas in front of the walker’s advance. AT-STs provide escort to the lumbering walkers to keep away hostile infantry at a safe distance from the exposed underbelly of the AT-ATs. Normally infantry would also be tasked to provide escort, but by the time the Empire decayed into the Imperial Remnant manpower shortages would often see reactivated Dwarf Spider Droids replace them.

T2-B tanks were sometimes assigned to reinforce infantry which were low on manpower in order to supplement their firepower. The tank’s mobility also allowed it to harass the enemy forces as they advanced into range or pick off isolated groups of attackers.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_FLARE_S,Developed from the outlawing of Podracing and the rise of swoop racing to replace it in the world of high-speed galactic sports, the Mobquet Flare-S quickly became the most popular bike on race circuits. Equipped with many features that gave it increased speed and mobility compared to other swoops, yet despite this it is incredibly more difficult to operate than a standard speeder bike. Beyond the races the Flare-S was incredibly popular among swoop gangs, mercenaries and bounty hunters, leading it to be frequently modified with a forward-mounted laser.

Any vehicle which is not outright destroyed by the blast is then mobbed by the more numerous and faster firing blasters of the Gilzeans.

TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAN,The Imperial Military frequently use walker designs for their ground vehicles, with the AT-ST being a ubiquitous design across the Empire. The walker is a highly versatile vehicle capable of being used and refitted for many different roles beyond its initial recon designation. The base frame is capable of long range independent operations in small groups or acting as a supporting element for a larger force. No matter what it is being deployed for, the AT-ST is a highly devastating foe for any infantry or light vehicle. However, with the decaying industrial and logistical abilities of the Empire, its walker platoons often need to substitute in the outdated AT-PT to replenish them to full strength.

TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAF,Despite the Empire normally organising vehicle platoons into groups of the same vehicle model, they face mounting battle losses concurrent with problems with securing consistent resupply. This has forced many formations to mix vehicle types in order to ensure each platoon is large enough to be combat effective.

Given that the task of being a command centre means they are handling a large amount of real time data about the current battlefield, these vehicles also make for an amazing artillery coordination post. Thus Eriadu Army commanders often bring several artillery pieces along with their bases to give the commander the ability to instantly influence events on the battlefield without having to wait for the movement of troops or the ability of their subordinates.

In addition to recon missions, they would also be tasked with undertaking strafing runs on any vehicle columns they spot. This would delay or even stop enemy reinforcements from engaging with the fast moving assault columns that were synonymous with the Greater Maldrood.

Jax would use this position to orchestrate a plot to poison Palpatine's clones, leading to the Emperor's final death. With his co-conspirators forming a new Ruling Council, Jax aimed to take the Empire's now vacant throne for himself.

It is relatively slow and vulnerable to any ground based threats however, and thus needs to be guarded. Under advisement from General Veers after he found himself tied to Eriadu's forces, Eriadu's armies use Imperial Army Guards for this task due to their increased heavy firepower.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_CHIK_APLA,Chik Apla was an Imperial commando who was once a member of The Emperor's Royal Guard. Even after Palpatine’s death Apla would wear and maintain his armour with pride well into the New Republic period. He would eventually retire from active service following the Pellaeon-Gavrisom treaty, where he would become lazy and spend most of his time in bars. Apla ended up being recruited by Derran Takkar, while Apla was having an affair with the Moff’s wife, to ruin the wedding of Luke and Mara as a statement against the New Republic. Apla would be captured by Mara in a failed attempt to assassinate her.

She later discovered the espionage of Prex Chils Meplin and attained the rank of Auditor-General. In addition to her CSA career, Fiolla ran her family's landspeeder business on Lorrd, expanding it to service and sell starships.

TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_HAPES_AAM,Star Home, while imposing in size, is not really a warship.

This led to it being adopted both as a front line hovertank combatant but also for a long range heavy scout. In the service of the both Greater Maldrood and Kosh Teradoc's Deep Core armies it is often partnered with smaller recon vehicles like the AT-RT, who can visually identify whatever is located by the Swift Assault’s sensor package. In return the Swift Assault provides a massive increase in combat ability over the smaller vehicles, and thus can safely engage a greater range of targets. The mobility of these units also leads to them being used to skirmish with any enemy assaults to delay their movement, allowing other allied forces to position themselves better.

TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_ZSINJ_AAG,The Compact Assault Vehicle/Wheeled 10 was a light one man tracked vehicle which was used in large swarms to engage infantry or primitive vehicles. While highly adept at engaging those targets, it struggled against any modern vehicle remotely capable of warfare. Hence it was common practice to have two squads of PX-10s form a light element of the platoon and then ULAVs could provide a heavy element in relative terms. The ULAV was still a fragile vehicle, but it had the mobility to keep up with the PX-10s and it possessed far more firepower including anti-vehicle capabilities.

Its onboard weaponry is surprisingly weak for a ship of its size as a result, but its vast reserve of fighters and bombers more than make up for it.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EA_AAR,The famous Imperial AT-AT is the main assault walker of the Eriadu Authority and a favorite of Superior General Delvardus since his acquisition of a stockpile of them. These massive four legged walkers are an indomitable force head on, but are extremely exposed to flanking attacks or infantry getting in close. For this reason it is common practice for commanders to designate escort vehicles such as the AT-MP to screen these threats away from the AT-ATs. History has also proven the ability of airspeeders to pose a threat to the lumbering beasts, and thus AT-AA walkers can be included in the escort group of the AT-ATs to keep the skies clear of threats.

TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_ZSINJ_AAO,Internal Security Operator teams are the assault formations operating under the purview of Imperial Intelligence. Their disruptor rifles provide them with increased firepower while also minimising any trace of their passing.

TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_HAPES_AAJ,The Heavy Air Squadron is based around a single element of Vhork Gunboats and their heavy AV beam lasers which make short work of all but the toughest ground vehicles, while lighter lasers from the Vhorks engage vehicle and infantry alike. Two Flights of Silanus Speeders provide support by engaging any enemy crippled by the barrage of laser fire from the Vhorks and also distracting any enemy airspeeders active in the area. Braver pilots of the Silanus speeders also engage any enemy air defence systems to fix their attention. They do this while also providing targeting data back to the Vhorks which can then destroy anti-air emplacements hopefully before the Silanus speeder is shot down.

However, while its flak pod is extremely capable of dealing with hostile airborne threats, the AT-AA is extremely exposed to any ground based threats. Even when the walkers are located behind the front line where they are ostensibly safe from ground attacks, it is important to keep up a guard force around the battery to protect it from enemy raids. Reluctant to “waste” manpower keeping an infantry screen around the vehicles, most Imperial commanders delegate the task to recommissioned battle droids.

TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAG,In order to compensate for lacking the vehicle required in their official Table of Organization and Equipment, some commanders took to militarising vehicles commonly found in their local vicinity. The Treaded Neutron Torch was one such vehicle which became utilised as an ersatz heavy assault tank in Imperial-held regions such as Kessel. Combat experience with the converted mining vehicle found the design to be highly capable against enemy vehicles and fixed fortifications but its weaponry proved ineffective against small mobile targets like infantry. Thus it became common practice to partner the TNT with smaller vehicles such as the PX10 which could act as a screen against infantry and small vehicles.

With the Emperor's death, Pestage took the role of ruler of the Empire for a time. He would attempt to raise Imperial citizens morale through acts such as establishing the Church of the Dark Side as a state religion. Conflicts with both Isard and the Imperial Advisors would see Pestage deposed however, with mixed reports of him being assassinated on his homeworld of Ciutric, to simply retiring to the sanctuary world of Byss.

TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_NR_AAQ,The Mobile Proton Torpedo Launcher-2a was the artillery system of choice for the New Republic, however it was fragile and needed to be set up before it was capable of firing. This necessitated that the vehicle stayed safely behind the frontlines, however this still left it exposed to aerial attacks. Thus competent commanders often protected the MPTL with batteries of T1-B tanks, which could shoot down air attacks with their flak pods. Backline infantry provided security for the vehicles to prevent any infiltration raids on them.

These well drilled and highly motivated soldiers are given some of the best equipment available in return for being expected to spearhead all the major assaults taken out by the Empire, while maintaining a constant rapid reaction ground force. The decline of the Empire forced some Stormtrooper units to reactivate old battle droids such as the Dwarf Spider Droid in order to supplement the capabilities of a platoon or to mitigate the impact of losses due to lack of manpower.

TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EOTH_AAB,The Empire Of The Hand is not a large galactic power, yet they face many enemies in the Unknown Regions. They do not have access to the massive pools of manpower of other factions and thus they need to be extremely careful about the lives of their soldiers.

TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAM,The Deathhawk is one of the many airspeeder designs utilised by the Galactic Empire. Deployed in formations of three airspeeders, Deathhawks patrol vast areas of a planet to ensure there are no threats to the Empire present. If threats were located, they could inflict devastating strafing runs on ground targets. A preferred tactic was to have one speeder strafing the target, meanwhile a second would be resetting for a new attack run and the third would be lining up for its run to ensure a constant carousel of fire on an enemy. A Scout Trooper can be attached to the formation of Deathhawks in order to act as a forward air controller, coordinating the airspeeders and ground elements in the local area.

TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAU,The Elite Guard are a special shock formation of the Stormtrooper Corp deployed to protect VIPs, especially when they are near warzones. Their protection duties do not confine them to standing close by to their VIP, but necessitate rapid relocation in addition to securing positions ahead of the VIP. Some squads of the Elite Guard also stand by in reserve along with their gunship transports in order to respond rapidly in case any threat is detected. The IDT is commonly used in this role due to its well-rounded combat abilities and respectable troop bay. This means that the IDT can deploy its squads even in a hot LZ, join the fight against any threat, or extract the VIP safely while under fire.

The AT-ST would also see upgrades to their weaponry with the AT-ST/A variant. The Empire hopes these increases in firepower would result in better battlefield results.

TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_GM_AAG,The AT-AA is the standard anti aircraft vehicle used by the Galactic Empire and some of its later breakaway warlords. While it is lethal to any aircraft in its local vicinity, the walker itself is vulnerable to any ground attack. For this reason, it is common to assign ground units to escort it. While most warlords prefer infantry as close protection, both Kosh and Treuten Teradoc's Army commanders tend towards assigning AT-RT walkers as escort. These small walkers are capable of searching far more territory than squads of infantry while also having the firepower to deal with small raids aiming to take out the AT-AA.

The original framework for the Vengeance Frigate had it armed with a pair of mass driver and turbolaser cannons along with conventional shielding, while esoteric variants would strip the shielding for an internal cloaking system.

These units always contained COMPFORCE Observation units directed by a loyal officer in a Chariot LAV appointed by either Zsinj himself or his right hand man, General Melvar. As the units are near the frontlines they could be called on to assist in defensive or offensive operations and were also outfitted with rapid response PX-10 units.These vehicles also gave the formation the ability to persuade any hesitant imperial forces that it was in their best interests to follow their orders and go into battle.

The demand for these sniper teams mean that it is necessary for airborne transport to be utilised to facilitate their rapid relocation.

Nebulon-B Patrol Refits attached to Acclamator MK2 hunting groups provide important support in rapidly dropping the shield protection of NR warships to allow the array of turbolasers on the Acclamator to devastate the now helpless vessel. The Nebulon also provides much needed anti fighter screening for the Acclamations which had been noticed as a weakness of the vessel.

TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EA_AAQ,The Eriadu Authority's officer such as Octavion Sorin made use of a hover vehicle for their artillery platform, which uses the normal Imperial artillery cannon to deliver firepower at long ranges. Given that its range far exceeds the platforms own sensor capabilities, it is common for the Eriadu Authority's commanders to partner each Medium Mobile Artillery Hovertank with several 64-Y Sled Speeders. These act as long range reconnaissance to enable artillery fire to be called in on target as soon as any enemy ventures into range.

The Swift Assault rides on a cushion of air rather than repulsorlifts which limits its speed and maneuverability compared to repulsorcraft, yet it is easy to maintain and preferrable on worlds where repulsorlifts behave erratically.

TEXT_TOOLTIP_NEBULON_B_PATROL,Originally an Imperial convoy escort design, the Nebulon-B design would go on to see countless refits and variants as Imperials and Rebels sought to use the cheap but versatile frigate to meet demands.

These ion weapons are a direct count move against the New Republic’s reliance on strongly shielded ships and fighters and noticeably improves the frigate's capabilities against shielded targets.

Ulric would end up becoming the Baron of Taggge when his remaining brothers “died” in the Omega Frost incident, forcing his retirement from Imperial service to manage the families holdings.

Taking over small groups of elite forces such as the Imperial Army Commandos to use as assault troops is beneficial for the ISB as it allows them to achieve their objectives while minimizing ISB casualties.

TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_NR_AAL,The Scout and Retrieval Vehicle was one of the few new vehicle adoptions of the NR post-Endor, although it largely served with second or third echelon formations which were not expected to see heavy combat. This meant it was often seen with garrisons on backwater or unimportant worlds. Similarly, despite the army reforms of the NR after the Dark Empire, not every foot soldier was able to rapidly adapt to the new standards or simply could not receive the new equipment due to the burden of galactic wide logistics. Thus it would not be uncommon to find groups of NR infantry armed in a similar manner to how they were armed in the Rebellion even late into the NR’s rule.

The turmoil this created forced the majority of the Imperial Army to keep using the older Firehawke for its repulsorlift armour needs. Normally deployed with only 4 vehicles to a platoon, when heavy combat is expected the Order of Battle of the Imperial Army allowed for additional vehicles to be attached to the platoon to bolster its strength.

While the aesthetics of the Gozanti was not to Hapan tastes, its capabilities would prove useful in supplementing and later replacing the older Stinger gunship in border patrols and small scale anti piracy operations.

TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_IR_AAT,The Self-Propelled Medium Artillery walker comes in several variants which swap the primary weapon system depending on the mission requirements. SPMA walkers required for indirect fire are equipped as the grenade variant which lob a powerful high explosive shell at extreme ranges. This weapon system massively outranges the sensors onboard the SPMA. Thus, SPMA-Gs are reliant on others to provide accurate targeting information. Such a complex job is difficult withoutspecialised equipment, such as that found on command vehicles like the PX-4 Mobile Command Base. The presence of such a vehicle meant that a fire mission could be called upon seconds after any enemy presence was detected within the range of the formidable artillery system.

While it is able to outfight most capital ships, it requires an escort to not be torn apart by bombers.
TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_EOTH_AAC,When Empire Of The Hand forces encounter enemy infantry which are heavily entrenched, they prefer to assault the position with specialised armoured vehicles instead of using infantry.

Bulwark MK I while smaller than the MK III are available in larger numbers and are armed with the same weapons thus help to contribute to mass of laser and ion fire reaching out to devastate a single large threat.

TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_NR_AAT,While the T-47 was a highly popular airspeeder in the New Republic Military, the rigours of the high intensity warfare that occurred after the death of Palpatine at Endor exposed many weaknesses to the design. The V-wing was intended to be a successor to the T-47, but its roll out would be slow. Thus many of the older T-47s would be forced to remain in front line service to make up the numbers required. When these older formations found themselves in important campaigns, flights of the newer V-wings could be attached as reinforcement.

TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_NR_AAP,Developed for the NR as a purpose built combat airspeeder, the V-wing proved to be highly potent and would rapidly start to replace the T-47 in combat roles. With a heavy armament and good speed, the V-wing was a lethal threat not only to hostile ground vehicles. but could also reliably engage and defeat enemy airspeeders and fighters which had entered the atmosphere. Their effectiveness would lead to most worlds having garrisons of these speeders, and the NR often brought them along in special transports when attacking enemy worlds.

The Hapans tend to keep these systems in reserve to avoid damage to their own cities, but will deploy the Parallax in battles away from their own urban areas or when on offensives outside the Cluster. Royal Guard infantry provide protection for each launch system as it is extremely vulnerable when its stabilisers are active, which lock the vehicle to the ground.

TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_PA_AAH,Being mostly positioned in the Northern Galactic Rim, the Pentastar Alignment had retained a far greater percentage of Clone War surplus than other areas of the Empire due to being lower priority for new equipment. Thus instead of the more common AT-AA, the Alignment is forced to use the Clone Wars era UT-AA despite its shortcomings. As it is exposed to any form of ground attack, infantry with heavy weapons are nearly always stationed as pickets around the vehicle to keep it well protected on the battlefield.

This was necessary for them to perform their far reaching missions such as long range reconnaissance. While Scout Troopers often spend their time on speeder bikes, granting them the speed and endurance to range out from their base, they could also often dismount if their mission required. Scouts are renowned as snipers and teams of dismounted scout sniper teams can wreak havoc at long range. As the snipers take their toll on the enemy, speeder mounted Scouts raid enemy lines to keep them pinned or finish off those hiding from the sniper teams.

TEXT_UNIT_FLUFF_GW_PA_AAL,The Commission for the Preservation of the New Order provided some of the most fanatical supporters and believers of the Empire, and Imperial warlords wasted no time co-opting elements of the organisation for their own benefits. The fanatical troops of CompForce made for excellent assault soldiers which could be augmented by the addition of the Guardian Protector squads of the Pentastar Alignment. These former COMPNOR soldiers make good assistance to their former branch personnel, especially when they liberally use their flamethrowers to flush out enemies from their cover.

Will we be able to weather the storms and the difficulties of forging a new union? I wish to establish a Jedi academy. Under my direction we can help students discover their abilities, to focus and strengthen their power. This academy would allow us to restore the Jedi Knights as protectors of the New Republic.

TEXT_CONQUEST_PENTASTAR_INTRO_FIVE,Gregor Raquoran: That fool Kaine has leapt into his own grave! Now the Alignment lies leaderless; yet our industrial and military power remains unspoiled while the rest of the galaxy recovers itself. The Chamber of Order is trying to decide on who is leading us now,  but I suggest Commander you secure our territory in the meantime. The Velcar Sector is the highest priority of course; just don't commit any suicidal gambits as Kaine did.
